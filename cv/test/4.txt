__label__Negative	stop sending me template you probably send to all `` non-essential '' businesses asking you same questions and give us some real answers . why is n't rent freeze for businesses who legally can not work out of your offices . if you 're to stay open for essential businesses who are actually supporting this crisis i think that 's great . but businesses who legally can not access your buildings due to global pandemic are getting screwed by you . good job showing your true colors wework . we 're definitely moving to another office share once our lease is up . one that actually cares about physical and financial health of their members .

__label__Negative	in normal circumstances my rating might be higher but i think you 've chosen seriously odd time to ask for feedback given we ca n't work in your offices during lockdown unless we want to increase our chances of getting coronavirus . i think you should give businesses discount while they ca n't use your services . ( my gym for example has frozen memberships entirely . )

__label__Neutral	thank you for offer but i won ’ t be able to this happen.i need to early terminate . i am also requesting time stamp with mac address for electronic signature of agreement .
__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid-19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no-reply @ wework.com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche.io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Positive	community team is exceptional and your flexibility during covid pandemic was first class .
__label__Negative	your company does not value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from us . during covid-19 pandemic you have not conceded any of your membership fees and in fact suggested that we expose our staff to virus by sending them to office because wework was `` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense '' pretense being that majority of their locations remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze us for few nickels now you 've lost potential for any future dollars with us .
__label__Neutral	yesterday ’ s stay at home order from governor and county of los angeles means that our team can no longer legally use our wework office space . i am writing to request refund for remaining 12 days of month . our bill for march was $ 13,239.16. $ 13,239.16 * 12/31 = $ 5,124.84 refund to clusteralso since it is not clear when we will be able to utilize our office we would like to cancel our lease and have our deposit returned to us .
__label__Neutral	our team is working remotely until we understand outcome of covid-19 pandemic .
__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to service issues were for lack of better phrase something that 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during covid -- zero offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cancelling my contract and finding new space .
__label__Negative	with covid-19 concerns on rise prioritize auto-flush and hands-free feature in bathrooms . for kitchen i 've heard multiple people complain about microwaves being too low and all high-use items are all together making it very crowded space . are limited printers available and printer i use most ( 4th floor ) usually is in need of attention . sharing printer is also problematic with people releasing sensitive print material from another person using group ; consider individual printer log-in accounts . finally we need more privacy options to protect company sensitive information .

__label__Neutral	i hope you and yours are safe and well.thanks for message . have you seen messages i ’ ve been sharing with my building manager at international house ? these are regarding fact that due to government guidelines we can ’ t use our office yet you are still charging us full rent and not prepared to discuss how this will affect my business my staff and all our livelihoods.please can we speak directly as this would be my preference rather than involving wework network my trade body legal team and arnold ash legal team .
__label__Negative	frankly disappointed that no suspension scheme available during this virus outbreak and most facilities and events are suspended and cancelled basically forced to pay but nothing is provided .
__label__Negative	i really enjoy lot of things about wework and i love weekly events as well ! my biggest feedback ( only because of corona virus scare ) is cleanliness of door handles and areas that are frequently touched like microwave fridge bathroom doors water filter buttons etc . i think handles of objects have to be cleaned more frequently because you can see fingersprints on these when they are dirty . also people are constantly leaving wework cups in bathroom and it 's kind of gross . i think we work guests should not be allowed to wework cups or mugs into bathroom if other members use these cups as well . ( no fault to cleaning team at all on these they are best ! )

__label__Negative	too slow to respond to covid . my business had to exit 3+ weeks ago due to failure to implement correct vetting of visitors . really really poor response in allowing all and sundry to visit with no regard for wellbeing of clients within your premises . like ( d ) facilities otherwise pre worldwide pandemic that you were woefully slow responding to so did n't rate any lower .
__label__Negative	if wework is able to suspend our membership until covid-19 crisis passes we would like to stay . date we stopped using office due to government advisory to keep all non-essential work remote was 16 march so we request suspension from this date . if this is not possible unfortunately we have no choice but to cancel .

__label__Negative	i ’ m not happy w coronavirus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your staff yet told us we can keep coming to work even though you that we are mandated to stay home during this crisis . in your carelessness you may have even caused more contamination all in service of still collecting rent.i noticed that on very first day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank acct . we are small business and i really think your actions are irresponsible and not community-oriented.since you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn ’ t ring true.i suggest given we can ’ t use our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely

__label__Neutral	thank you for reaching out and we appreciate all that is being done by wework to assist in these interesting times.a question i have asked wework in both south africa and london ( where we have office ) is whether wework will be sending out some official communication around any potential plans to pass down rental savings or payment holidays in line with some of local government initiatives that are being published . as you can imagine these will be great help for us and many other small business which up such big part of wework ’ s member profile . i had standard company response last week stating we understand that current situation confronts all of us with challenges and wework is dedicated to supporting its members in these unique circumstances . we are working with our leadership team to decide best way to move forward and we will communicate with you all when we more . i am wondering if this is still being looked at ad when we can expect some more information from wework on this.wishing you all best and looking forward to hearing from you .
__label__Positive	enjoyed my stay at wework very much as it is coming to nearly 3 years i did have some ups and downs in where wework was not meeting standards above all i have enjoyed every moment in wework and i will be seeing you again once coronavirus has settled and business runs back to normal . thank you for everything you will be missed very much . kind regards hari bhuva
__label__Neutral	we 're no longer working out of office due to government restrictions . how will you be assessing rent ?
__label__Negative	everything about how wework has handled this covid situation has been poorly managed . in weeks leading up to full outbreak / closure was not single hand-sanitizer jar to be found in our offices . bathroom was routinely out of papertowels . one of sinks in women 's restroom has n't worked since we moved in late last year . you 've continued to your staff go in when things were getting worse . i had conversation with one of cleaning folks and they were genuinely afraid for their health but did n't want to lose their job . now we are banned from working and you are trying to upsell us into 12 month lease ? and it 's taking you weeks to figure out how to handle our situation ( and i 'm sure everyone else is in same boat here ) . meanwhile answer should be pretty obvious . other co-working spaces have paused agreements but you 're still trying to squeeze out any last dollar in last ditched effort of self-preservation . while we loved staff at our location and loved product in good times mismanagement during bad times are enough to force us to look elsewhere when this is all stabilized .
__label__Negative	wework office is great - but it 's of no use to me because i ca n't access any of it during this covid crisis but you are not communicating what membership options are . you will lose so many people whereas reduction or negotiation in fees might see me holding onto my place and waiting this out ... has been so little proactive communication from you . this is not way to deal with this crisis .
__label__Neutral	will building be open in case i need to pick up items from my office ? are special hours that building will be open ? my wework is 25 taylor st san francisco ca .
__label__Negative	only reason i gave lower marks for office is that i wish frosting on windows went up higher - too much visibility into our office which can compromise confidentiality . some companies on our floor use shared space for what are obviously lengthy internal meetings.i strongly feel that ending coffee and beer service and honesty market is an overreaction to virus situation . cleanliness and common sense should prevail . now we have to go out to to convenience stores and coffee shops - wastes time and we interact with lot more people .

__label__Negative	i we work has its own financial issues to contend with as that has played out in national media but i think some covid discount or refund for april when we are not allowed to use space would be nice gesture . we work was designed for start-up 's `` on edge '' and most of us have had to incur additional costs at home . i my org could really use extra funds . we have deferred any training income to our own partners to help them better serve their youth .

__label__Neutral	i am sure we will not only to ask but we wanted to see if wework was offering any concessions or rent abatement for month of april . as you can imagine our travel clients are suffering ( like all industries ) and we ’ re being asked to drastically cut fees for next month ; as five-year wework member we wanted to see if discount might be available for next month . i this isn ’ t necessarily your area but wanted to see if you might be able to discuss on our behalf with sales team . appreciate consideration .
__label__Neutral	firstly we hope you and all your colleagues are well and safe during this time.at aaron basha it is our upmost priority to protect safety and well-being for all our employees . due to recent news and uncertainty surrounding covid-19 we had made decision to heed warning of federal and local authorities and require our employees to conduct business at home until it is safe for everyone . we are also doing this since our employees rely on ny and nj mass transit to to work.we would like to what concessions wework is currently giving tenants if any . for this reason we are requesting concession and relief in our monthly rent . although wework is giving its members options where to work since is limited staffing we do not feel shared environment is safe .

__label__Negative	wework concept is amazing i think were some physical and management issues with no.1 spinningfields being new building and wework has been through some changes corporately since i invested two years ago which has affected service negatively . overall i 'm satisfied but with reduced level of service it 's become too expensive alongside market changes ( brexit / general election / coronavirus ) which have negatively impacted my business . i 've also encountered two members at wework that lack integrity and i do n't wish to be associated with them . my business is 12 years old and i work with public sector agencies and reception staff did n't treat me / my clients with respect i feel we deserve ( they were n't as professional with wework members / visitors as their corporate occupiers in my view ) .

__label__Negative	when will leadership provide information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices today ( which we ca n't do again due to lockdown ) .i 've just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n't actually been setup and we can not move to or use due to lockdown ) .this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has had our revenue destroyed by virus as well.we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also cc 'd ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership.it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else gets screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework 's occupancy rate and financial health.i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .
__label__Negative	please put signs up at all of your locations telling people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds when leaving bathroom and before eating meals . i often see people leave bathroom without washing their hands.given it 's bad flu season and outbreak of coronavirus washing our hands is one of only defenses we have . please put signs up reminding people to thoroughly wash their hands .
__label__Neutral	wework like probably majority of your community members i am running small start-up business from office space i rent from wework . coronavirus has hit our cashflow hard and we are now in fight for survival of business . in meantime we are still paying rent for expensive office space that is empty as all my staff are working from home . one of my team had to go into our building briefly yesterday and said it was almost entirely empty so most occupiers are in similar position . please can you confirm what wework is to do to support your community of small business / start-up tenants through this unprecedented time ? not only are we as tenants all paying for service we ca n't use without support is very real risk could be no wework community very soon as businesses either go bust or chose to default on their rent . i ca n't imagine it would be in wework 's commercial interests to allow that to happen . i look forward to your response . ( i have already raised this matter with community team who did n't what to say )
__label__Neutral	i just wanted to reach out to you in regards to everything on right now surrounding corona virus outbreak . i we just started our contract but with way market is and everyone working from home office costs are really weighing on us . we are considering our next moves but before we do anything i wanted to see if is anything you can do about our fees .
__label__Neutral	thank you for this note – think it makes lot of sense . one ask… in order to to ‘ my ’ we work ( chancery lane ) i ’ m required to commute elevating risk of coming into contact with someone with virus . i have wework 100m from my flat – north west house . is any way that whilst risk is still elevated i could temporarily work from desk next door ? based on below guidelines would be availability and it should increase safety for all… including my pregnant wife and 2 year old . this would be really appreciated
__label__Negative	ineffective disconnected and uncoordinated response to covid19 crisis
__label__Neutral	dear azalia first of all we hope you and wework team are safe and healthy right now.as you we represent broadway shows and current shutdown of our industry has put us in very precarious situation ( like so many other industries and companies ) . to be completely upfront - currently affording our full rent will be massive challenge and we respectfully ask for your help during this time . we love wework and it ’ s important to us to be good and responsible members which is why we wanted to reach out as soon as possible with full transparency .
__label__Neutral	downsizing . waiting for corona virus to end .
__label__Neutral	cancelling with intention of returning once covid-19 stablizes . not safe to work in wework .
__label__Neutral	work from home due to covid -19
__label__Positive	i really appreciate how wework handled covid 19 shutdown in minneapolis . staff were communicative and struck right balance between providing services and closing some down .
__label__Negative	thank you for your email and i reciprocate hopes that you and yours are safe and healthy in this very difficult time . it is indeed very challenging for all of us and will hopefully not last too long . as to wework 's position on collection of our rent which i 'm certain is corporate decision and not an individual position on your part i have to point out again that we are under stay at home order by state of california . it is not legal for us to do business in wework facility at present time nor by extension is it legal for you to allow us to do so as non-essential business . wework 's `` obligation to our members to stay open for those that do rely on our space to operate as business and to those essential businesses who are still coming into our office as they are actively fighting covid '' does not apply to stride management and does not supersede fact that we are prohibited from doing business . clearly concept of prorated relief on rent has already been agreed to by wework as demonstrated by your decision to prorate rent when offices were unavailable due to recent cleaning . now again wework offices are unavailable to us and can not be used by our company . accordingly please suspend all automatic ach rent payments from stride to wework immediately and until this crisis has passed and stay at home order has been lifted by state . i am happy to discuss further with you or any other wework representative . i can be reached at 310-601-6792 .
__label__Positive	i 'll be back - lost couple of clients due to covid and it 's does n't $ $ $ sense to keep office for now ( especially as i 'm working from home and i have 1 person office ) . i 'll be back once this all blows over .
__label__Neutral	i am in live event business . we are ticket brokerage and sell tickets to live events nationwide ( concerts theatre sports etc -- pretty much everything that has been canceled ) . like many others covid is to have drastic impact on my business . we do not expect anyone to be buying tickets int he near future . which pretty much eliminates all incoming revenues . i am also following instructions of cdc and our government and not working remotely . is anything that can be done that can assist me in terms of assisting with rent pro-rating and/or holding off on payment until things clear up ? i do not expect to be at wework location for immediate future . please let me if anything can be done .
__label__Neutral	i had package delivered yesterday i intend to retrieve it today ( wasn ’ t able to redirect though it was attempted ) . when can i pick it up ?
__label__Neutral	thank you for update - i assume you will institute rent reduction given severely curtailed service ?
__label__Neutral	need to save money because of crisis covid has created
__label__Neutral	i love wework and people that work . it is covid issue and i 'll be back as soon as that is no longer concern . thanks .
__label__Negative	being charged for covid while not being able to use office is turn off . i tried to negotiate deal that would help compensate for time lost to no avail
