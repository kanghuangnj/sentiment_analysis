__label__Negative	although i appreciate this may not be your area we are tenant in 10 york road and as of today we have not had any meaningful contact from anyone at wework to how company will be passing on governments assistance to its tenants . given enormity of issue i strongly recommend wework action to help sme 's & freelancers or you wo n't have any companies left to occupy offices on their return .
__label__Neutral	i am now pleading for you to let us out of one of our lease spaces . i am not sure if we will be able to stay afloat and will need to be laying off multiple employees . we are run by broadway and production which has been cancelled and probably not coming back for some time . please let us what you can do . we had just signed it one week before i asked to out . is any sort of loop hole with that ?
__label__Negative	please all these doors you have to open 1000 times per day open automatically when you use your card on reader . it 's been pretty annoying an also health issue since you openend but in days of virus scare it 's even worse to have hundreds of people having to touch and drag door handles all time wherever they need to go . this has been terrible design since day one .

__label__Negative	best thing about wework - awesome staff @ funanall else - comparable to service offices apart from interior . wework in general is expensive for space and amenities ( or lack thereof ) we pay for . and despite covid-19 situation we haven ’ t really received or heard of much help from wework management team - plans to help any tenants tide through exorbitant rent or working arrangements set by mom laws .
__label__Negative	chris following message got bounced back to me . please be sure to distribute to kara as i do not have her email address.thanks . *************************************************dear wework dumbo community team i am writing this email to wework dumbo ( ny ) team regarding my year-long commitment to renting wework office at 81 prospect st. as you state of new york has demanded that all non-essential businesses close due to covid 19. this includes my business stephen dargo architect dpc.inasmuch as wework strives to remain open during this pandemic fact our office remains open ( with expectation that we will continue to pay rent ) is both selfish and antithetical to policies that our state and local governments are issuing stay in place do not leave your house do not work etc . members received following message from our wework management team this morning march 23 at 9:07am which goes completely against above referenced state mandate dear dumbo members as you wework has been monitoring coronavirus ( covid-19 ) pandemic closely and implementing measures to protect health and safety of our members and employees while providing our essential members with as close to normal operations as possible . what this means for you dumbo will remain open with wework members able to access their space using their keycard will be limited wework staff on-site but community team will continue to support you from home daily cleaning will continue to be carried out including enhanced daily cleanliness measures we have implemented since onset of covid-19 outbreak community team member will be onsite every day this week . you will still be able to pickup your mail and packages monday through friday . if you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this situation please feel free to reach out to us for assistance via email or support request . we are committed to sharing timely information and updates as we respond to this evolving situation . thanks community team at 81 prospectto say that we can all work “ as close to normal operations ” is not an acceptable position . we all that this is impossible dangerous irresponsible and potentially illegal as of this morning.i am requesting waiver for rent for my office effective immediately and to remain in effect until state mandated order to stay in place is removed . i intend on sending this email along with your response to governor ’ s office if my request is not met.wework needs to step up and be responsible company and alleviate burdens imposed by this event that we are all feeling and not to struggle to keep doors open for obvious financial reasons . we are all feeling major financial hit on this event while wework continues to collect rent as usual . this must stop now.i look forward to your response .
__label__Neutral	original request- pre-shelter in place- as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4.098 and 4.102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4.1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ m sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv-19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise that this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4.1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease.could we have conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request- post- shelter in place- i ’ m aware of recent announcement in new york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non-essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non-usage .

__label__Negative	wework should not be open . people keep testing positive for coronavirus . it 's irresponsible to keep it open .
__label__Neutral	what is being done as far as rent payments ? many businesses have no income during this period . can we defer rent payments and add them on to end of lease ?
__label__Negative	due to virus issue all service has taken away.for example no coffee no beer and even food market has closed . i understand risk control but hope wework can come up with any alternative service idea .
__label__Neutral	after covid-19 to larger and more basic space where i can fit all my books more like an artist 's studio than an office .
__label__Negative	you should explore being able to allow person to retain their desk space in return for keeping service retainer ( just stopping monthly payments ) or keeping small monthly fee running to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i.e . covid19 ) . i think that would show some loyalty to your members which they would return to you whereas only alternative i have is to terminate my membership .
__label__Neutral	i just received this update however it does not outline wework 's policies for non-essential business . due to extreme uncertainty of what is to come next and how long will government shutdown last until i would strongly request wework management to not charge non-essential business until is further clarity on situation . if possible please provide us with confirmation before end of this month on whether or not wework will continue to charge non-essential businesses for unused space . i hope during this time of uncertainty we can continue to build more meaningful relationship with wework . look forward to hearing from you asap .
__label__Neutral	right now - we are unable to use our office given covid outbreak and government shelter in place order ... we 'd like to propose rent abatement for duration of our inability to legally use our offices .
__label__Positive	we will always reach out to wework for office space in near future - within us and internationally as we have done in past .
__label__Negative	toilets are dirty most of time.office space is extremely dark ( when surrounding offices are not with their lights on it feels like it is night time ) way situation was handled with confirmed coronavirus ( covid-19 ) case was extremely unprofessional . whilst team tried to protect 1 member of entire wework they then put every other member at risk by not discolsing who they are . we were then not able to if we were in contact with them . i have younger children and elders with me as well as sick . had i known if was contact i would have needed to self isolate .
__label__Negative	yes you need to put sanitizer or wipes by all of your doors toilet seat covers and put trash cans by bathroom doors . are way too many shared doors and toilets throughout building for you not to provide these additional items with threat of coronavirus here in sf .
__label__Negative	it provides better small-space experience but it 's over-extended over-leveraged and i doubt it has long-haul capacity to survive this epidemic .
__label__Neutral	justin . i have not had opportunity to meet you yet . i just joined brace about month ago . i wanted to reach out about our new york space and see if is any opportunity for some sort of credit while we are all working remotely . with coronavirus at pretty epic levels in new york city we have had employees working remote for about 2 weeks and will continue this for foreseeable future.even if you can give us another month at end of lease - or two months if this continues ... any consideration at all would be appreciated . let me your thoughts . thanks !
__label__Neutral	i do not feel comfortable or safe coming into offices as i have asthma and can not be at any risk my service retainer is $ 2600 and my rent for next two months ill add up to that amount . i was planning to renew and join again as things settle down but it would largely depend on how this is dealt with . can you refund me half of my service retainer now and keep half ( so one months rent ) and then cancel for march 31st . i feel this is more than fair given current situation . please let me .
__label__Neutral	they have signed commitment through end of july 2020. called me today and threatened me for 30 minutes about having to pay and not use their space . said they have been member with wework for over 6 years at different companies and buildings . claim they will not be member again and business elsewhere if we ca n't help them . said they will stay and grow in future if we can help .
__label__Positive	whole cleaning staff ! during everything covid related they have been regularly checking/cleaning everything and are always very friendly !
__label__Negative	this e mail came from new york office . are you all not listening to what is on in nyc ? ? ?
__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .

__label__Neutral	amidst this covid 19 scare we are all confined to working from home and are highly unlikely to come for entire month of april 2020. hence it would be great if wework can waive off membership fee for april 2020
__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non-essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid-19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well-being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Negative	no option to pause payment during coronavirus outbreak
__label__Negative	1. i think that service quality has gone down bit since reorganization of corporate . we always experienced lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated.2 . has been no effort to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this covid crisis.3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4. part of wework 's value prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited to 9am to 6pm this does n't reflect way business is done in nyc . 5. our front desk does n't open until 9am . in normal nyc building desks are staffed 24/7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .
__label__Neutral	we need to continue our business in virtual way due to covid-19 . once that passes we will then seek an office at that point in time .
__label__Positive	during covid-19 crisis we will be scaling back to virtual 'wemembership ' relationships as well as keeping two colleagues in hot desking spaces in vancouver . once crisis passes we will be seeking physical space and ideally staying with wework .
__label__Negative	- 30 day notice for move out should be lifted ( or flex 'd ) for month-to-month people ( we could n't have about covid & we are stuck paying for something we wo n't use which for business of three is directly taking from personal income . )

__label__Neutral	dear wework team i am writing this email in light of recent worldwide events and circumstances surrounding covid-19 . i was hoping we would not have to resort to this but our company elite sales and services ( gvb ) has experienced an extreme reduction in workload and revenue as vast majority of our clients have been forced to shut down and freeze operations . given that state of california has implemented shelter in place policy and that we are not allowed to resume our regular operations at wework we would like to find way to relieve our financial burden while at same time maintain our responsibilities owed to wework . by means of this email we would like to ask that you postpone or reduce our rent due for months of april and may . we have been large customer of wework for some time and would greatly appreciate support in these trying times . it is of extreme importance to our company to maintain relationship we have built with wework and that we are able to continue our operations after our nation has surpassed this unexpected blow . we are hoping that we are able to come to an understanding where both elite sales and wework are able to find mutual grounds during these difficult times . please feel free to reach out to me directly . looking forward to your response .
__label__Negative	i have enjoyed my experience at wework until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . for me option to be able to hot desk in other locations was one of main perks and something i will miss . for me crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to expose its members and front-line employees to risk were deal breakers .
__label__Positive	will likely return post covid-19 .
__label__Neutral	i hope you are well . i am emailing as i wanted to inquire about canceling our membership . due to covid-19 we are having to adjustments in our budget to adjust for all revenue loss we expect to happen in upcoming months . at our restaurant down way we have lost all of our events through may and have seen dramatic decrease in business due to everyone working from home which is to have long term effects on business in upcoming months . once we recover we would like to come back .
__label__Neutral	i have greatly enjoyed wework and it 's been an incredible experience . staff other residents facilities . and i hope to return . but for now i 'm leaving with hope that by not being in communal space all day i have better chance of not catching virus or at least delaying spread . thanks !
__label__Negative	we 've been happy with office and community team . elle stan tom & byron have been most helpful . we will miss interaction with them moving forward . covid 19 situation has made it impossible for us to sustain our office unfortunately .
__label__Negative	weeks prior to covid wework was doing nothing to stop its spread . no alcool gel anywhere nothing . they said they sent warning messages to people i didnt receive anything no signs anywhere . this was eminent and coming and nothing was done . i lost all trust in you guys .
__label__Negative	due to covid 19 i have to cancel my membership and wework is charging me for month april . it is very mean to stick with contract during this period . we work had to end our contracts at end of march . also issuing some compensation for march would be appropriate .
__label__Negative	so i guess you were on spring break beaches of florida - it is ok to congregate . i am shocked by these emails ? ? .
__label__Neutral	because of covid-19 i 'm working from home now . just switch to hot desk for now although i may not be often due to current covid-19 situation . will upgrade to bigger room in future when things are getting better .
__label__Negative	really disappointing response ( i.e . none ) to covid . no communication relating to rents or rates for grants . abysmal for one of largest commercial property providers in world .
__label__Neutral	we are currently tenants in 880 3rd avenue . as you can imagine our business is being heavily impacted by current unprecedented situation . therefore we need to freeze/ reduce our rent obligations immediately . who can we speak to ? based on phone call renovata does executive search// face to face interviews and companies are placing these hiring processes on hold// revenue streams are frozen
__label__Positive	thank you for everything ! i really wish i could have stayed . however current covid 19 situation will likely keep me at home for time being .
__label__Negative	right now we work has had 2 corona virus outbreaks and is an office we can not use
__label__Neutral	they will empty office by april 1st and want to how much sr will we keep .
__label__Neutral	we have been charged whole fees during covid-19 quarentine
__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .
__label__Neutral	just shifting down for moment during covid - will sign up for another smaller office shortly when we move in policies
__label__Negative	i did ask for space for two of us but pricing was too high . i though given availabilities in my section alone would have been more wiggle room pricing . subsequently with virus its just not economically feasibile anymore .
__label__Negative	i loved working there- but with covid you left very bad taste in my mouth ... shira and morgan were always extremely professional and responsive.. they were best part of working at wework
__label__Neutral	good morning . now that all wework locations are closed due to covid-19 . what happens in regards to monthly charge ? will this be reimbursed or not charged at all ? many thanks
__label__Neutral	covid 19 has changed long term plans .
__label__Neutral	thanks for getting in touch . still waiting for decision on rental payments . would be great if you could address that .
__label__Negative	i ’ m sure you ’ ve had similar response to your email such as following . we ’ re now locked down nation and told to self isolate and not travelto non essential work . and so desks i and many have rented have been rendered useless . as dictated by our government we need to practice self isolation to protect ourselves protect others and protect our nhsso why are wework not doing anything about this to help members who are rendered home bound and working remotely by freezing desk rents until these restrictions are lifted ? ! ? this is utterly ridiculous and unfair . many other members are making lot of noise about this injustice on various groups not least because this reflects badly on wework as company and its practices . please send out communication which addresses concern of most of wework members with fair and satisfactory resolution .
__label__Positive	i 've had few difficult calls with westlake tower members today but their overall appreciation for our continued ( and positive ) communication is definitely apparent ! they mentioned how much they miss coming in and how when all this is over they ca n't wait to come back to office . quote from pm `` we absolutely love you guys '' and then proceeded to comment on how truly kind and supportive we are .
__label__Negative	moving to larger office space once covid 19 is over it was always our intention and this has just brought plans forward .
__label__Negative	please decide on how to operate under corona virus or refund tenants for their rent . we are n't getting any value for what we are paying for .
__label__Neutral	i still do n't anything to dring here due to coronavirus . nothing special here so far .
__label__Neutral	business temp . shut down until july . all tv shows they work on are on hold until further notice asking to move out now on commitment until august 2020. can not afford payments also does not feel safe to access la17 due to covid-19 case found in building .
__label__Negative	it would 've been alot more helpful if wework made accommodations to honor my request to cancel membership end of march due to covid-19 pandemic instead of sticking with membership agreement of 30 day notice to move out . in other circumstances i would have honored lease agreement .
__label__Negative	it ’ s criminal that you are staying open . shut it down for love of everyone ! ! ! this is like saying “ we ’ re gon na keep 24hr fitness open because one of our members is firefighter ”
__label__Neutral	this member is requesting to downgrade into an office less than $ 2000/mo willing to extend current commitment . theyre on commitment through january 2021 .
__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) .but i was little disappointed to see today - i felt ok coming here during pandemic b/c not lot of people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .
__label__Negative	organization is so unorganized . i have dedicated desk and they have no way of knowing who has what desk and they randomly assign desks and ca n't even keep track of them . i am most upset with how poorly they have handled covid 19 and am planning on switching to work space that takes public health seriously .
__label__Negative	you should 100 % be closed while covid-19 is around .
__label__Neutral	thanks for update . if we already have parcels in parcel room is anyway of gaining access to these ?
__label__Negative	our business does not qualify as essential under new york state law . therefore i want to if we will be getting credit for our rent while we can not access office .
