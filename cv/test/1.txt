__label__Negative	well i 'll say it again . i do not think it is very neighborly or decent of y'all to uphold 30 day move out policy for folks that have been laid off as direct result of covid-19 . especially when they cant even legally utilize that office space at this time .
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and willingly increase infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Neutral	subject to amendment to agreement between ww 1460 broadway tenant llc and papaya global inc. dated june 30 2019 we hereby give notice of termination of agreement.according to current situation in which our employees work from their home and do not use their membership we will ask for your consideration to terminate engagement even before termination date pursuant to this notice ( 2 months that end at may 17 2020 ) in order to reduce our costs.please confirm receipt of this termination notice and advise on process ahead .
__label__Negative	for now too much downsized ops . due to covid-19.. currently only bottles of water is served but appreciate more variety and revitalizing concession stand .
__label__Negative	in this unpredictable time where covid 19 is widespread and i noticed that recently one of cleaning staff has been showing up to work sick and coughing without covering her mouth for over week out of an abundance of caution i decided not to continue with renewing my membership . i do n't want to put myself health at risk .
__label__Negative	members have been failed by wework during covid . every day their is news story about your board fighting with softbank and question of wework cash flow is constantly in question . your response has been to pretend nothing is happening and not reassure members . it ’ s really disappointing as brand has always been about members but when it came to it wework has not provided .
__label__Negative	i am sorely disappointed with how wework london handled this matter by dragging their feet and coming back with less than empathetic offers in spite of covid19 extraneous circumstances .
__label__Neutral	loss of clients from covid 19
__label__Neutral	financial issues due to covid-19
__label__Positive	work environment is great and staff are very positive helpful and professional . kaitlyn herzog is doing fantastic job especially given current corona virus situation .
__label__Neutral	corona virus safer at home
__label__Neutral	mark hope you are fine . what crazy situation ... because of covid -19 we have not been working in our office for more than 10 days and won ’ t come back before 1 month or more… moreover 2 of our employees will leave our company . that ’ s reason i have 2 questions 1. is it possible not to pay half march and 100 % april rent ? we do not use our office because of this exceptional time and need your help for our costs . 2. as team will reduce can we move . 1st of may until 31st of august for 2 desks office . 1st of sept we will need 3 desks office . thank you for your flexibility and return .
__label__Positive	will come back to wework once coronavirus stabilizes
__label__Negative	wework is breeding ground for spreading disease particularly in state/city where people continue to ignore safety measures put in place by state government . this is irresponsible to say least . stop putting your financial interests before human lives . conscience and close your locations for god ’ s sake .
__label__Negative	after reaching out months ago about cleanliness issues ( and repeatedly before that ) and trying to go to month at our current rent rate we were met with much resistance and sort of `` too bad '' response . even despite poor service we decided to go month to month while agreeing to an increase in our rent . then on march 16 we submitted request to leave based on covid above mentioned concerns concerns about shared workspace continued issues with cleanliness etc . we were only offered relief if we engaged in signing contract to long term agreement . such bad policy especially in time like this . feels very much like opportunizing in time of crisis . seems ironic for company that is supposed to foster strong sense of community care to be so unsupportive in current state . eveytime in past several weeks that we wework email i think this must be rent adjustment policy or pause in membership etc . but it has never come . we have very bad taste from this `` wizard of oz '' answers always where people working at tower49 said they did n't have authority and would send an email request to those higher ups . we are exiting immediately . upon stay at home mandate being over we will collect our items . if anyone would like to reach out to me please feel free to call me at 917-972-2872 .
__label__Negative	disguising and you should be far from proud way you have behaved ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no response to tenant queriessending cleaners in to clean empty buildings # coronavillains
__label__Neutral	although our contract says 30 day notice i am asking that be waived due to covid 19 outbreak . when its all clear i will still need workspace . if you are fair about refunding april rent since i did not use space for most of march as well i will consider using your space for our company . thank you .
__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it 's clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men 's room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high.the water bottle/fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands.the general sentiment from office to our office manager is when are we moving ?
__label__Negative	could have been more proactive when it came to covid19
__label__Neutral	mark ok i understand even if i am disappointed you did not offer me anything… ; ( let ’ s move for 2 desk 1st of july . is it possible to have available 2 desk office next to us ? we ’ ll see for sept if you are 3 or 4 or more ...
__label__Neutral	to my house dawg . covid tingz .
__label__Negative	we really think wework is very good but because of corona virus we want to stop wework for this period maybe will move back after virus i try to contact wework staff at end of jan but because of chinese new year and virus are noone reply me . wework open very late like 10th of feb due to virus and we move all our stuff right away . we want to ask for end day is end of feb but your staff must end till end of march ... ..i think in special situation should treat us with some consideration not just go by contract . its very disappointed ...
__label__Neutral	would return in private 4 seater working from home now due to covid-19
__label__Neutral	thank you for updating us on situation . we are requesting that meyer law group be considered an essential business conducting essential activities per county orders.our need to enter building is not significant but our value to community is quite critical to bay area .
__label__Negative	i liked everyone here . location of my particular desk was odd in this weird mezzanine thing that involved too many doors and security swipes to to coffee . coronavirus does n't help desire to go to shared coworking space .
__label__Positive	sydney has been great manager for us especially as we navigate through this unprecedented time . we wish to acknowledge and thank her for her service . we hope that we will reconnect with wework once covid situation has been resolved .
__label__Neutral	we are requesting march 31 end date per our earlier email correspondence due to covid 19 and downturn in our business . we want to be placed on `` pause '' for month of april while we sort this out . we will try to remove all of our belongings by 3/31 .
__label__Neutral	taking away all amenities during corona virus feels like completely transparent cost saving measure . you can milk at conbini but not here ? really ? no ice maybe makes sense but no coffee or market is far beyond necessary . other than that place was great staff is incredible !
__label__Neutral	as agreed you will keep our service retainer pending our return in june 2020 subject to covid 19 and we will retain our deactived cards and keys ready for reactivation upon our return .
__label__Negative	whole coronavirus is creating lot of uncertainty and as business is new one i do not feel like paying expensive prices of wework when government most likely announce soon no one should go to work and people remain home ...
__label__Negative	this is totally irresponsible .
__label__Neutral	will offices/meeting rooms in san francisco remain open for members to use ? if not will wework be waiving membership fees ?
__label__Neutral	apijet occupies 6 offices at westlake tower in seattle totaling 47 desks . all 47 desks up are for renewal 7/31 . they are requesting to early terminate all their offices except for their 12p . in exchange for this flexibility they offered to sign for another 6 months on 12p ( 7/31 - 1/31/21 ) . apijet provides defense software for airlines carriers . as airlines industry has been hit very hard by covid-19 they need drastically less space to continue operating as company . they are long standing partners with wework having been members since 2016. just three weeks ago they were looking to expand their presence with us by 30 % and we were planning on touring them on 50-60 desk skus this week ( before covid changed our plans ) . when we through covid-19 they want to grow with us again . given business impact they 're seeing becuase of covid and long standing partnership we 've seen with them over past few years i believe this warrants consideration as an exception .
__label__Neutral	do you have any plans to offer payment freezes or discounts ? we are in aldate tower well we aren ’ t for next few months !
__label__Negative	wework has shown no flexibility with recent covid-19 pandemic and impact it has on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance they receive from employer and world health organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and member agreements should have flexibility . at this point not sure i would return to wework when all this is over .
__label__Negative	wework is not what it was not because of virus pre-virus . cleaning staff and people who coffee have no relationship with members and are not enough of them . member network is dysfunctional . member benefits are not up to date promoted ( discounts on goods and services ) or pat of experience . learning events are not in line with business needs . are less perks . furniture needs help . community staff is doing more with less and are always trying to help .
__label__Neutral	working from home until covid-19 crisis passes .
__label__Negative	dirty bathrooms expensive lack of any message or effort in middle of covid-19 crisis in my building excess of people on same floor lack of meeting room - it ’ s really bad and not worth money
__label__Neutral	thank you for your email . i already sent email of support request to west broadway location ’ s email . our company is one of essential business . ( to go food service ) if you need more information please let me .
__label__Neutral	john sheehy6:30 am ( 3 hours ago ) to mehi mir i understand you might be considered essential business unfortunately we are not so we have no rights to have our employees come into wework which i am sure is empty.i can ’ t warranty we can stay till december because frankly our situation is so volatile at this point . if you can cancel april rent for us we will stay for our our lease if not i will need to ask to cancel our lease immediately . how do i do that and what is procedure ? i hope wework will into consideration that we where one of 1st tenants in building even before we would move in.please let me as soon as possible . thanks john
__label__Neutral	our wework contract is up this march 31 2020. we were unable to start our move out last week due to office being closed on thursday evening and friday . as non essential business will we still have access to building to complete move out this week ? has cleaning of building been completed given members who have tested positive ? i would prefer to go to building in evening and on weekend so we risk less exposure to other members .
__label__Neutral	working from home but will rejoin wework once covid is over .
__label__Positive	thank you for hosting and supporting us since 2015. we look forward to reengaging once covid has been mitigated and normal business resumes .
__label__Neutral	i need place to work as my company has closed its offices for fear of coronavirus exposure
__label__Negative	i am stuck in australia because of covid 19. i anticipate coming back in future !
__label__Neutral	sounds great . but i just need to have rent relief during this time .
__label__Neutral	primary member steve hanshaw informed myself on call that as their company is startup they are not doing well in this economy and does not have funding to pay april 's rent . they really love wework and do not want to leave but he is looking for what his options are for following scenarios:1. immediate move out2 . freeze membership until after covid19 is over3 . giving 2 month notice but still breaking commitment
__label__Negative	i think way you 're handling your tenants during corona virus pandemic is poor . 50 % rent reduction when govt . has issued stay at home order ? i was big fan of weworks but not now . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful now that i would refer anyone to weworks . we 'll pay your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stayed with you forever . not feeling like i want to stay in place that charges tenants that have been ordered by govt to stay home ! terrible upper management decision making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for you .
__label__Neutral	- cbi 's clients are suffering . this member is an advertising agency for e-commerce companies that ca n't ship their products . they are experiencing significant cash flow problem . they said things should be super challenging next 4-8 weeks .
__label__Neutral	since i am in high risk i have been under order to stay home . i can not come out to access my office . is any sort of waiving of service agreement until crisis passes and i am free to go out . i am not generating income i was before i was categorized as high risk . thank you and stay safe

__label__Neutral	leaving due to circumstances of covid-19
__label__Neutral	my we work office was luxury for our business not necessity . i can work from home but wanted to be in community environment . since that community experience is no longer and i am not comfortable working from public office building i am to work from home . we ca n't pay for luxury expense when we are not using office nor do we feel comfortable and we do n't how long this covid situation will last . i would consider renting here again in future should it financial sense for us . we truly did enjoy our time here .
__label__Neutral	are sanitizer stations present at tower location in burbank ca ? also are cleaning wipe still available for use ? thank you for your help .
__label__Neutral	we are member of london marks square community and as i ’ m sure you are aware uk government regulations are stating that people remain at home and are only permitted out for essential activities . strict regulations currently in place in uk mean that we are not in position to use facilities/services at marks square . we are an ngo with added complication that it takes us about year to claim vat back on wework fee and next 6 months will be putting an economic strain on our operations.i have been trying to find out for some time now what support you/wework will be giving us in respect of our membership fees . similar organisations to yourself are providing rent relief to support their members through these very difficult times.please can someone back to me as matter of urgency .
__label__Negative	under normal circumstances i like facilities . but operations under risk of potential corona virus is underwhelming .
__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in-house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april.besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in-office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote.as situation is progressing we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .
__label__Negative	expense freeze due to coronavirus ... i will be back when finances better

__label__Negative	i will personally sure that everyone i and work with has full understanding of way wework has refused to negotiate or work with us during covid19 crisis and complete devastation of our customer base .
__label__Negative	so if we 're not essential and ordered to stay at home are you providing refunds for rent ? i 'm not sure why we should be paying if we are n't allowed to come in and front desk staff is n't even working anymore nor can we packages or mail .

__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020**hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated.the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays at current level.the additional space is very much to be surplus to requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able to use space for foreseeable future.i that we have contract until july so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated.i look forward to hearing back from you.bestleon devereux
__label__Neutral	since i am not “ essential ” and ordered to stay in place at home in ca will wework be waiving my membership fees during “ shelter in place ” order in ca ?

__label__Positive	thank you for keeping your facilities open at this time . i have been using my wework office as it is safer than my home for work .
__label__Negative	support offered to businesses during covid-19 has been very poor especially when other co-working spaces are offering discounts or rent holidays .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus outbreak
__label__Positive	wework strives to create community and not just create space . in these challenging times ( covid 19 ) is still constant communication flow and are activities scheduled for online interaction . to me this rocks ! ! !
__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter.as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions/ potential recessions in market.i need to some facts/ figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place.we currently have lease that ends in approximately july/ august and monthly rental $ 12,257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space.while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this '' [ cm team responded with policy ]

__label__Negative	you have been treating our company terribly during covid outbreak . i would never suggest another business to receive same treatment
__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n't let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we 're not supposed to go in to office so we ca n't even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us was trying to lock us into one year commitment .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus fear
__label__Negative	considering that we are in unprecedented times to corona virus issue and visiting wework would not be possible/allowed at least for next 3/4 weeks time due to restrictions it would be great if wework not bill for this & next month .

__label__Positive	although we are not to renew contract as result of covid 19 crisis surely in future i will consider possibility of returning to work in this tremendous workplace . i would like to say thank you guys .
__label__Negative	i rent small office in dalton place manchester . your email below gives lots of security and reassurances for wework staff but absolutely nothing for tenants . now that uk is on lockdown what ’ s next steps for buildings ? also is any plans in place to pause or reduce invoices to reflect current situation ? or are you keeping them open so that we ’ re forced to pay full rent . wework are not essential buildings to keep open ; most of not all businesses should be working from home .
__label__Negative	central we work handling of covid-19 and treatment of members and community teams during this time is appalling . we work are putting staff in danger and punishing small businesses that utilize buildings by refusing to close and charging full rent .

__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and good spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours.based on nature of our business ( face-to-face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay off employees and close our offices in nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer need these office spaces.i 'm sure given nature of weworks work this is also not an ideal time for you all and i 'm sure you have bunch of different things on as far as managing this nightmare.so for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due to `` shelter-in-place '' order they 've closed office to all `` non-essential businesses '' in philly due to confirmed covid-19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening date.after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to reopen spaces we have with wework . however we need to cancel our memberships in those spaces asap.is way to immediately cancel membership to those spaces for april billing cycle or what exceptions are you making for times in which shared coworking spaces are regulated out of our control by government ?
__label__Neutral	since i live in nj and i commute into city… i am no longer able to do so . what are protocols for getting mail and rent ? since i am unable to travel and my business has been affected what is being done about rent ?
__label__Neutral	( thread with member is very long see next box for request ) member doesn ' want to break their 2 year commitment but they are ready to forfeit their sr as `` sunk cost . '' i do n't see any tools that we have to pause their membership unless we want to offer them 2 months free to try and keep their business .
__label__Negative	why do n't you allow me to freeze until covid situation is clear
__label__Neutral	just saw that wework will be closed due to virus . i was curious does this mean that our payments for next month will be paused until we have further clarity on situation ? since office space can be significant cost in burn would love to some info on same .
__label__Negative	my business is not an essential business . it is service business involving groups of children gathering ( dance classes and camps ) and i had to shut down completely . i have no business to run at moment . i am self quarantining and have two young kids i must now homeschool . please advise on how you will relieve business like mine as i am not able to go to “ work ”
__label__Neutral	due to cornavirus out break we would prefer to stay and work from our own home for now we are trying to avoid public spaces & transports but will be back once situation settle down . its been very pleasant to work within we work we will definiate return !
__label__Negative	i really enjoyed wework atmosphere and people . i ’ m only canceling due to corona virus as i can not use my membership at this time
__label__Negative	disappointing response by wework to covid . incentive offered to keep me after contract up ... not to help weather storm together .
__label__Negative	with current covid situation nobody wants to be in co-working space
__label__Neutral	whole infrastructure has been collapsing slowly but surely . we are in midst of coronavirus outbreak and we have ice buckets out in open because fridge has been broken for at least month without getting fixed .
__label__Positive	scheduled time on inside sales rep ' calendar to discuss 1-49p spaces
__label__Neutral	are any provisions for pausing my membership since i am not able to use space ? or is my only option to cancel and re-enroll when buy local restrictions are lifted ? thank you
__label__Neutral	your email is very nice and heart warming but ignores real issue about what concessions wework are to to assist companies with cashflow in these difficult times . do you file business rates declarations on our behalf if you our accountant says if we have details of these we can possibly claim grants.are you to offer companies rent reductions or payment holidays to help them with cashflow
__label__Negative	i 'm deeply disappointed by wework 's refusal to pause contracts in light of covid . as our non-profit faces serious financial crunch wework has thus far been uninterested in sharing hardship .
