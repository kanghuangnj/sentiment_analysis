__label__Positive	amen ! my community is not under lock-down . while i am vigilant about social distancing and sterilization… i need to work at my office . thanks ! ps team at preston center rocks !
__label__Neutral	we 'll be back.. sorry to go because of covid-19 ( see you on other side ! ..
__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear back from building management . and yes it ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non-essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move-out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to me they could be considered an “ essential ” business…on related note were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to be further work done in coming days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current circumstance.lastly please keep me posted once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously stated i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality…many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and effort.sending my best grant
__label__Negative	whilst i have been completely satisfied with wework until now i do n't think that wework are handling covid situation particularly well - i have been waiting for weeks to hear whether or not you will be doing anything to support your members who are individual/small businesses and have heard nothing . other places/services i subscribe to in my life have communicated clearly offered frozen memberships etc yet wework still seems happy to monthly payments for desk i ca n't sit at . it 's unlikely that i will still be wework member this time next month - and for company size of wework i would have expected better crisis management .
__label__Neutral	if covid restrictions continue after may 1 and you have not rented out space we are leaving 28-052 please agree to keep our belongings and we will move out ( part to 28-013 part out of bldg . ) at our first opportunity . thank you .
__label__Neutral	liked culture people customer success team i have interacted with observing their politeness and support specially akshay amanda nishita & hiral.i found wework is right place for startup to motivated being in competitive environment and having an opportunity for collaborating with people from community . wework have many centers for business focusing on location specific for flexibility . an effort that is being addressed to build community surely will evolve in coming time.most importantly need more people to arrange washroom hygiene suggesting office space cleaning staff & workers should have more safety in terms of masks food hours proper shoes masks and gloves ( where ever required ) . right measures for prevention of stopping spread of coronavirus as it becomes threat of working in large community together . kind of health protection and care wall designs at washroom and pantry display outlets .
__label__Negative	i 've worked in weworks before ( times square and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches have food/crumbs/stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events /popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else 's lunch crumbs or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .
__label__Neutral	dear wework covid support in response to your earlier email today we operate an essential business . therefore please consider this request for support by avanza capital markets inc. as an essential business under governor cuomo ’ s march 21 2020 new york executive order 202.6. avanza falls within essential business definition 7 “ financial institution ” defined as “ financial institutions including banks insurance payroll accounting services related to financial markets ” as securities and exchange commission registered broker-dealer regulated by financial institution regulatory authority and securities investor protection corporation . please continue to support us and permit access to our office space . if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me victor gill or manuel sevilla .
__label__Negative	yes . posterity will judge you for not doing right thing when other coworking spaces are leading way in shutting down and helping their members with small margins and small teams not risk catching covid by continuing to use coworking . shame on you .
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .
__label__Neutral	fyi i planned to turn from 1 seat to 3 in april and to more than 10 by end of year . so is small delay but covid wo n't stay here forever .
__label__Neutral	this pandemic is to create financial stress and would suggest to bring down your rental so that its possible for us to rent desk once covid-19 lock down is over .
__label__Neutral	besides fact that i ca n't use office now my revenue was also hurt by covid .
__label__Neutral	will surely resume once this corona virus pandemic is over
__label__Positive	thanks for constant and continue communication on building status in connection to coronavirus . weekly freebies from vendors to sample new stuff are great along with activities coordinated by community staff ! community staff are very helpful and friendly .
__label__Negative	thank you for your service . we look forward to covid-19 crisis ending and to scaling back up to physical offices with wework .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus working from home for forseeable future see above answers
__label__Negative	although wework is great place and structure to work fact that nyc locations have not shut down ( especially locations where covid had outbreaks ) is both irresponsible and inconsiderate to both employees as well as those who have to return to an unsafe environment .
__label__Negative	it is very regrettable that an option to pause or offer reduced rent was not made available during covid-19 crisis . if this was an option i would have stayed . however is so much uncertainty regarding covid that i had no choice but to cancel my membership until i when covid crisis will end .
__label__Negative	wow . basically wework is contributing to spread of this virus and pandemic .
__label__Positive	great place to work ... just not during times of covid .
__label__Neutral	as with everyone else aduivo too is feeling pinch . as of 3:00 pm today i have been forced to terminate 98 % of my staff across three businesses . my restaurant closed in allen my call center closed in dallas and i will be closing aduivo as well as this covid-19 runs rampant across nation . we will be back full-force when this clears but question today is deferment of current rental obligations . is anything in place to help small businesses until we 're able to rebound ?
__label__Positive	good environment but due to covid 19 used space sparingly .

__label__Negative	at what point are wework spaces in new york to coronavirus threatseriously
__label__Negative	what about cleaning etc. will workers be in or working from home ?
__label__Negative	lack of materials resources . technology does not work . irresponsible management of covid19 crisis
__label__Neutral	they originally asked for rent abatement for 2 months and are now further asking to completely terminate their 21p . they also are asking to switch their payment method as they will not have enough in their for it to be debited out in april .
__label__Negative	remain open ? essential business ? you are greedy - can ’ t wait until my agreement is over !
__label__Negative	i love my co-working space and community at universal north in dupont circle dc . however i will still like to see more aggressive support for small businesses that call wework home . during this difficult covid-19 pandemic i would hope that wework already provide some payment options/extensions or rent reduction to help with strain on halt of business activity throughout this health crisis .
__label__Neutral	! staying home for covid quarantine . will be back when this is all over . thanks !
__label__Negative	overall i love offering -- i have been fan for years . however i 'm not sure i agree with how wework has handled covid response for members .
__label__Neutral	client reasoned that their employees do not feel comfortable in or are mandated not to by government and they are not using space for next few months . they are looking for some sort of flexibility and understanding so that they can continue to grow with wework in future as management team and all employees really love wework .
__label__Negative	my experience with wework has been very good . my frustration is regarding wework 's covid policy . due to regulations in our state we have not used our space for weeks and likely wo n't for next month . these are extraordinary circumstances and i would have expected more cooperation with tenants to work on pausing accounts while we are enduring such financial distress . i was told that office remains open so we will be charged .
__label__Negative	this is business orientated email and truly does not consider financial impact . how selfish !
__label__Negative	great but not so fun . corona virus and poor coffee quality .
__label__Negative	until last week you ’ d have gotten much better score . i don ’ t like way you ’ re dealing with this coronavirus crisis . you ’ re open even for non-essential work in places where that ’ s now illegal . it ’ s an actual health hazard .
__label__Neutral	we are all currently working from home due to covid-19 . we are working with commercial real estate agent who has identified numerous available office space that fits our needs .
__label__Neutral	guys if we are being told from our state and city not to go into wework.. are you crediting any charges occurred during this mandated quarantine ?
__label__Neutral	i am likely to return to wework in event i can recover financially after coronavirus situation . in meantime i will have to work from my new home location in cherry hill nj .
__label__Neutral	work from home until mess with covid says that travel is safe again
__label__Neutral	i am inquiring on behalf of company i work for collaborate in regards to process in retrieving our mail that has been sent to this location . i understand location is currently closed due to covid-19 restrictions . is an estimate date for reopening at this time ? if not is possibility that our mail could be forwarded to different address during this time ? please advise at your earliest convenience .
__label__Positive	we have absolutely loved our time at wework and hope that when craziness of covid19 is over we can return .
__label__Neutral	member is willing to extend an commit for longer term however would like an additonal 20 % off discount for remainder of year .
__label__Negative	ca n't commute to wework with covid situation . wework has not been flexible with membership options .
__label__Neutral	i am not an essential service provider . what does nys stay at home order mean for my wework membership ?
__label__Neutral	because of covid 19 it makes no sense for me to continue membership right now .
__label__Negative	i hope you 're all doing well and keeping safe . i 'm not quite sure who all i need to escalate this to as i would really prefer an honest answer to my question vs canned copy/paste response . based on latest update from shay and continued order by governor baker we are requesting wework to waive reduce or defer rent in light of this situation . it seems to me wework is trying to maintain that it 's business as usual and quite frankly this is fooling no one . this is n't usual for anyone and we need companies like wework to recognize this and accommodations to its policies . just as you are taking precautions to modify your staffing we are doing same it 's about doing right thing and not trying to put profits before people . please let me who i can talk to about this . regards sk p.s . we 're apparently are n't only ones who are disappointed in this decision . it 's really quite sad what has happened in new york i hope wework employees are recovering .
__label__Positive	my job is currently in process of getting people to work from home or remotely . i 'm looking at options in which this is only temporary where if i can be able to use my work computer and use it to do work while in this remote space
__label__Negative	week ago we were informed that at sonycenter someone has tested positive with covid i message all community members with some questions and week after no reply at all ! this is an important issue and we could n't count with them . so we decided to cancel our membership because wework is n't as proactive as we thought
__label__Negative	close your locations ! ! ! ! stop making it easy for people to go out . please !
__label__Negative	still use we work . but we work has not helped us for virus period . still charged office for something we chave not used
__label__Negative	due to recent shut down in ny due to covid-19 of non-essential business it is presumed that wework will be pro-rating our monthly rent for month of march and until such time as we have clearance that we are permitted to return to office from federal state or local government . kindly inform us of what if any paperwork is necessary to be completed to receive proper credit . if any paperwork is needed kindly forward it to my attention . if direct credit will be applied please inform accordingly . thanking you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter . i ’ d like to discuss my with someone . state of ca and city of los angeles have mandated that we stay home and not venture out into public spaces and workplace . other companies we have relationships and monthly contracts with have suspended march and april rent payments and they will re-access for may . we tried to go to our office on saturday and parking garage was closed . we were forced to park on street and subsequently received parking ticket . once inside building bathrooms had not been cleaned and floors were dirty . our facility is not being cleaned and measures are not being taken to clean and sanitize any more than they have in past . mandate from federal government is to stay away from public spaces and we feel that wework isn ’ t designed to support this mandate . i ’ d like to talk to someone about getting credit for march as well as not paying for future months until this virus and global pandemic is behind us . furthermore financial hardship of having this payment each month that we can ’ t work out of is to be painful . please advise .

__label__Neutral	what cleaning measures are you guys taking in regards of coronavirus ?
__label__Neutral	while we do not believe we are in “ essential ” classification we may need to access our ( wework ) site in order to continue to provide “ minimum business operations ” ( “ mbo ” ) to our workforce as permitted in executive order . while we do not anticipate explicitly needing such access we do have certain it/other supporting resources on premise required to allow us to continue providing mbo . we have been advised that building will be accessible on after hours programming and this should be sufficient to allow us to meet mbo however we would require notification should building access situation change .
__label__Negative	none of that . i that wework owns meetup inc. wework claims to have health and safety of its workers and clients as top priority . meetup group in boulder colorado called hikers anonymous is breaking all rules for stopping spread of covid -19. tomorrow they are taking an outing of 12 people snowshoeing not 10 or less in state guidelines . they are also carpooling ignoring social distancing by crowding multiple people into cars for 90 minute drives each way . it 's irresponsible and dangerous to whole country by contributing directly to spread of virus . it also often leads directly to infection and deaths of people in vulnerable groups . i realize this is n't your area but please route this message to proper people in charge including meetup inc .
__label__Positive	i will be back . i love it just need virus to under control .

__label__Neutral	( ... ) i 'm writing because given our similar businesses i 'm hoping you can help me . our industries are getting rocked right now and we 're reaching out to all of our partners ( i 'm guessing wework is doing same ) to ask for help.with our workspace landscape dramatically shifted for unforeseen future i am hoping we can some rent relief . our plan with new space was to grow rapidly our team month over month and fill space . ironically we had less than 2 weeks in new space before we had to send out notices that employee 's needed to begin working from home for their health and safety.like us wework has dramatically scaled back office operations to barebones crew and most of services that wework amazing will be paused until we back to sense of normalcy.please let me how you can help . we love having you as partner and hope that together we can through these crazy times together.sincerely

__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our desks and equipment in place until 9/30 . that way you it easier for us to move back and re-contract with you once covid-19 resolves . if we do not come back by 9/30 return security deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .

__label__Neutral	is any relief that wework could provide us during this time ? what our general counsel suggested upon reviewing our contract was to postpone our monthly payments for period of time with commitment from us that we 'd then add those months to extend our lease when it runs out ( mar/apr 2021 ) .
__label__Negative	love wework - but without any staff at location no mail service ups packages now bouncing and with no drink services i 'm not sure it 's essential or beneficial to our business . prior to covid outbreak it was solid 7-8. with some minor aspects to improve on . now it 's really not any value added from it all . thanks frans

__label__Positive	i had great experience at town square we work and loved it . due to covid-19 i first was n't comfortable using shared workspace and then we had to shut down our start up due to covid-19 so we can not pay for space . i would definitely use it again in future under better economic and health circumstances .

__label__Negative	dear wework team we have been users of your product for some time and have loved experience . but in past few weeks our small business has taken major hit . if we can not cut costs we will have major chance of shutting down . wework represented for us 80 % of our costs as we just upgraded our plan and got closed office for 3. we tried to cancel but we are forced to pay two full months and we wo n't see our deposit only in few months . we are requesting that you consider refunding us for month of april and give us back our deposit . we have been loyal customers for while but we did not any use out of product for this period and if not for strictly cutting costs we may not be able to return to using your product in future . i hope you understand and ’ s something you can do to help our situation .

__label__Neutral	alyssa abby elsa and jolenethank you for taking time to speak with us yesterday.as discussed with current situation of covid-19 and per instructions of governor cuomo and mayor de blasio simple description of situation is that everything has gotten to complete stop . we are no longer using space nor do our clients hence we are unable to generate income form space.in order to it possible for both of us to keep working together in future ( this crisis will pass it 's only matter of time ) we ask to freeze our membership for 2 months ( april and may ) at this point . this will help us back to business together when this is all over and for longer term.as an early member ( maybe even first one ? ) at hq by wework ( singing our agreement in october 2018 ) who was real design partner for hq by wework product we will appreciate your understanding and your support in these challenging times.out intention is to continue doing business with you in future but we will need your help in order to that happen.stay safe and healthy guy

__label__Neutral	looking to pause my membership with corona virus
__label__Neutral	unfortunately we can not commit to extending our lease on either office at this time . we are asking that you please go to upper management as suggested in your email and please ask for april 's fees to be waived.three notes 1. by mid-april we will have better understanding of what our business looks like in this new reality.2 . by then we will understand what government programs we may benefit from and can impact our decisions.3 . even if wework continues to remain open all of our team members are under strict orders from our state governors `` safer at home '' for california and `` stay at home '' new york . we simply can not access our offices or services they offer .
__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .
__label__Negative	we offer services to restaurants and food halls our projects were cancelled because of corona virus which has interrupted all revenue . we are no longer able to afford monthly office space and have no need for it as our work is canceled our staff was let go and business owners are working from home .
__label__Negative	really sorry about this . i loved few months i spent at chromium but uncertainty related to covid-9 is to linger for god knows how long (
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space.effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to.here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out.if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this.we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer.please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24-48 hours .

__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to covid-19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i 'm korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between those hours.also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work.the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels.the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and ammedities are good.lastly employees at wework do n't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .

__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment.as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance.the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and it appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter-on-place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020.please confirm . thank you.best katie
__label__Neutral	dear mathieu and covi support team at wework further to email below we have not had any response so we assume you have accepted our rent holiday request . we really appreciate your help in these difficult and uncertain moments . thanks and regards carmen .
__label__Positive	i love space it 's just difficult financially because of covid 19 epidemic .
__label__Neutral	i ’ m not able to fill anything out when i open link . my company mtk resources is staffing/recruitment company and we have people out working currently . i don ’ t need to be office everyday but do need access to office . i certainly don ’ t want people to have to be on site just for my occasional access however is it possible for me to have access to building if needed .
__label__Neutral	... everyone is working from home due to covid . does n't seem like great use of resources to lease workspace
__label__Negative	bathrooms are poorly maintained . sinks are unreliable soap and paper towels were not stocked . also room was generally untidy . this was at start of coronavirus panic .
__label__Negative	thanks for sending out this message . whilst this is all very nice it does n't respond to any of challenges your longer-term tenants like my company are facing . will wework pass on reduction of business rates here in uk to your tenants ? are you able to offer tenants short term ( i.e . 3-month ) rent freeze with rents them adjusted up for following period ? i love my wework office and community team is great but so far i would give wework hq big fat zero in terms of engaging and responding to your paying clients . i look forward to hearing from you soon .
__label__Neutral	given covid-19 how can we arrange to keep all personal belongings and computers in storage or set-aside until we can come back to them ?
__label__Positive	to all of us in community who are into buildings and maybe even questioning `` why '' at this point ... .had really amazing interaction yesterday worth sharing.i went in on my rotational shift yesterday and collected mail to distribute . i noticed one of pieces of mail was obviously check for our member company took picture of letter and sent it to member.he texted me back and was beyond grateful . inside of this envelope was large check from customer that he needed to continue paying his staff through this crisis and was n't sure that it would ever come.these are tough times but it 's good to that executing on even most basic things we provide really matter right now . stay strong out community team ! ! if you have n't heard it today ... thank you for what you 're all doing !
__label__Positive	we 've enjoyed our years at wework and would certainly look at options to return once restrictions on business due to covid have passed and business returns to pre-virus levels . thanks for your help over years - we hope to return . regarding move out terms - i 've discussed with sydney kantoff at 57th st - email below ( copied ) is what we discussed regarding move out date . thanks for chatting with me . we truly appreciate your understanding throughout this process . as i mentioned we are flexible on move out times and dates . we understand if come may 31st city is still on lockdown and your team may not be able to come retrieve talent retriever belongings . will no charge . let me if you have any further questions . best sydney
__label__Neutral	we are small business and highly exposed to live sports industry and with all events being cancelled/postponed until further notice i 'm sure you understand that we are having to drastically manage our costs to ensure we can do right by our employees and see this difficult time through . '' `` https //www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/new-york-gov-cuomo-orders-100percent-of-non-essential-businesses-to-work-from-home.htmli think wework will need to be more flexible on credits and cancellations based on this .
__label__Neutral	it would be great to keep in touch when crisis with covid-19 is over . thank you for everything !
__label__Negative	typically i would give higher score but i have been really unimpressed by roll out of protocol and procedure during coronavirus outbreak .
__label__Neutral	working from home till things stabilize with covid19
__label__Neutral	no issues just not using space during covid-19 shutdown .
__label__Negative	i had pretty decent experience with wework up until this point . i informed wework team morning of april 1st that i would not be renewing my contract ; this would be my last month . they indicated since my request did n't come in on march 31st ( less than 10 hours before ) . i had to pay for an extra month . this is really unprofessional especially given covid-19 situation . i have n't been able to use my office since march 13th .
