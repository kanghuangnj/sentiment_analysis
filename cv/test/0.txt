__label__Negative	response to covid is appalling
__label__Negative	were certain promises made at time of contract execution that were not fulfilled . i wish these items would have been included in contract . is lack of parking . 0 privacy and you can hear everything in office next to you . conference room phones do not work . acoustics in conference rooms are horrible . cleaning amid coronavirus was very lack luster . utensils are hand washed and then laid directly on table . our office area is not vacuumed . it is very frustrating to arrive at work at 7 am and not have access to coffee until cleaning crew arrives at 8:30 or 9:00the first group of employees at wework were very difficult to work with ( adriene matsudaira ) team that now manages our site are great to work with lindsey palmer alexis hesse .
__label__Negative	i just do n't feel safe to go back to wework during coronavirus outbreak .
__label__Neutral	i will be back after covid ! !
__label__Neutral	unfortunate timing with coronavirus ; we enjoyed short period we were at wework .
__label__Negative	i am disgusted that you are keeping facility open and telling your members to come in come in still use your cards ... we have new wifi system ... this is unethical . not only can you not provide reception services but you are deliberately adding to spread of covid19 .
__label__Positive	i wanted to inquire about virtual tours of sf wework spaces . 50-100p starting in november
__label__Negative	nope . one thing that concerns me is mainly with situation of illnesses occurring ( i.e. covid-19 ) how is cleanliness of common area-shared cups/mugs ? sometimes dishwasher may not clean cups too well ... so just this concern of shared items/appliances .
__label__Negative	you should be closing your offices because of covid-19 and refunding companies their rent for time that they can not be utilizing facility . big coworking spaces are not safe place to be thus you are disregarding health and safety of tenants and your employees .
__label__Neutral	home office due to covid-19
__label__Neutral	there- form did n't work last night . please advise ... we are at 11 park place fl 4 in manhattan . maypole environmental inspections .
__label__Positive	home for now . will definitely become member again once virus runs its course .
__label__Negative	wework should be issuing refunds during months where we are n't even allowed to work in buildings due to coronavirus . this has been extremely disappointing .
__label__Neutral	wfh until covid - 19 is better
__label__Neutral	are we to be allowed to cancel our memberships if this is prolonged ?
__label__Negative	coronavirus has showed wfh is better
__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end of may.our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we 've lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects.we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us.i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and humbly request that you pause our contract until end of may.if we ca n't operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round.we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we 're able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?
__label__Neutral	we would like to spend zero in april and onward while offices are closed or we are not working at office . after we return to work/offices are open for normal operations we are prepared to pay rent you we have now . we are prepared to commit to 3 or 6 months .
__label__Negative	not happy with your handling covid-19 situation
__label__Neutral	we work . we 're client iwth 30+ seats in wework at 114 william street in melbourne australia . we have heard that one of your premises in spencer street has been locked out due to covid-19 . we are concerned about risk to our business if facility in william street is locked out at commencement of business tomorrow . we urgently require response .
__label__Neutral	member would like to terminate their agreement in new york and denver with immediate effect . due to nature of their business ( mobile ticketing services for public transport ) and impact of coronavirus they will not be able to afford to remain .
__label__Neutral	covid-19
__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .
__label__Neutral	you had covid19 case in march .
__label__Neutral	dear blair and molly as we ` ve all been following covid-19 pandemic is causing many disruptions in retail space . to greater good of us all stores have been closed and people have been stranded at home without clue of what future holds and when this nightmare will end.unfortunately this has great impact in our business as fashion retail is very cash intensive business . and for small brand new growing brand like ours impacts are even greater and we need to quick actions to survive.we are confident this will end and everything will be back to normal and we will continue growing path we were so excitingly building . we just don ` t when and it doesn ’ t look like it will be soon.therefore we will need to terminate agreement we have in place with you as we are no longer able to honor terms we have right now.please let us how to proceed . we will be moved out by march 31st.thanks fabio
__label__Neutral	wework needs to some changes to its policies during covid-19 months for rent relief for its customers who are following local government guidelines to stay at home .
__label__Negative	1 ) me gustaría saber protocolos de evacuación cuando hay emergencias . 2 ) estamos en un edificio donde es muy complicado entrar y salir ( tiempo 2 elevadores muy tardados etc. ) . 3 ) los estacionamientos están muy sucios y los señalamientos no son suficientes o están incorrectos . 4 ) con la contingencia del coronavirus no hay antibacterial en las áreas comunes como en otros edificios/empresas .
__label__Neutral	i have already given few suggestions by and large staff is extremely helpful and friendly . i missed lot of work days in march 2020 due to covid it would be helpful if you could advise on that .
__label__Neutral	while i am not currently utilizing empire office i am allowed to supersede nys executive order stated based on this federal directive . additional documentation can be provided if necessary . https //www.cisa.gov/communications-sector while i do not intend to utilize empire office i am also not relinquishing option to do so for remainder of our contracted rental period . thank you for notification .
__label__Neutral	we regret to inform you that due to covid-19 we will be canceling our wework office agreement and member for arrive outdoors . in this time of national emergency and pandemic affecting los angeles we are heading call of president cdc governor newsome and los angeles mayor garcetti not to participate in group settings of over 10 people for safety of our staff and for safety of larger community . our office team will be working from home for foreseeable future during national emergency . it sealed decision for us today when governor newsome announced that we should prepare for schools to be closed for months . we are requesting that due to these extenuating circumstances we have tomorrow 3/18/20 be our last day of our lease agreement . and that we pro-rate cost of our lease for this month .
__label__Negative	though looking good facilities in fact are not user-friendly slippy floor too bright rooms if they are facing south no control on temperature no drinks/snacks served ( due to covid-19 ) no vending machine . it might be good to stop by and host guests occasionally but it is difficult and inefficient to work in here anticipating proper function .

__label__Positive	gener8 5-person startup has decided to keep one fully paid desk at labs despite needing to cancel their other 4 while they ca n't access office due to covid-19 . in words of founder sam `` we ’ ll keep this so that we can still stay close to you and be part of labs community .
__label__Positive	prior to covid19 epidemic we work seems to be ideal with working space and facilities to match with modern environment . with fear of disease spreading now i believe wework would implement up to date cautious practices such as social distancing in elevator and everywhere frequent cleaning and hygiene etc . i wish all best .
__label__Neutral	it depends on situation with covid . i can not afford to pay an office if i am not making any income .
__label__Negative	no relief on any request made due to hardship or during due to virus . also putting greed above people 's safety by keeping buildings open . i blame this entirely on finance not excellent staff .
__label__Negative	due to corona virus situation i dont feel safe being in wework space . i would like to ask for refund for rest of month .
__label__Negative	service and all offering have been cut apart from our rent . communication has been poor too . keep making cutbacks hoping people wo n't notice . most perks gone and no mention of covid 19 or impacts to its tenants !
__label__Positive	whole crew at wework 27-01 queens plaza n long island city ny 11101 is incredible . i miss on daily basis and i hope to be back after covid-19 .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1. inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2. value vs quality offering is not compelling at martin place location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single person office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .
__label__Neutral	please inform me once covid 19 situation has settled and wework is operating back to normal .
__label__Neutral	i have enjoyed my brief time at wework . i have couple of months of travel ( assuming that corana virus does n't mess it up ) in april and may . i will probably be back looking for one-person office in june . thanks .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 reduced wework activities.chances to meet and collaborate with other comapnies are really difficult now.on other hand i really appriciate that wework staffs are keeping rooms clean .
__label__Neutral	event staffing solutions is an event based business . due to new york state and city mandates banning large gatherings/groups cash flow of this business has come to stop . they are committed through november 30 2020. they are asking to freeze their as they are not to be able to afford upcoming rents for next 3 months . they want to finish out their commitment to wework and have no issues doing so . they simply can not afford to in moment .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 virus has deeply effected our company- by at least 50 % for this year i 'm expecting .
__label__Positive	hope you are safe team – you ’ re doing great job .
__label__Neutral	i hope all is well and you are staying safe and healthy.given significant increase in spread of corona virus across us and local government advice we have instructed all our workers to work from home as of march 16 2020.operationally our staff is able to work from home given phaidon ’ s heavy investment in technology in 2019 where we moved entire business to cloud.we are asking all landlords where we are not using their offices to allow us to defer rent for this period to end of lease term . our best estimate is this is likely to be for three ( 3 ) months.thank you for your assistance at this challenging time.respectfully
__label__Negative	- catastrophic customer service ( ramin in frankfurt ) - unreliability of services such as printer coffee machine water dispenser etc.- limited accessibility of post ( 2 hours day and they ( ramin ) give you shit for asking outside of those two hours while i have read that wework is considered to be an `` essential '' postal company in covid times to be open ) - inacceptable hygene measures ( how many hands have touched ice in ice machine ? ? seriously ? ! ) - feedback implementation based on kpis ( # closed tickets ) only rather than actually solving issues
__label__Neutral	will be back to we work once covid - 19 settles down .
__label__Negative	thank you for message . could someone from wework please cancel my commons membership ? thanks again .
__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .
__label__Neutral	conversation was over phone but she needs to conserve cash as her business is taking hard hit due to client retainers dropping on her side and is scrambling to cut costs . she states that she wants to be member with us after this season but she has to something lowered for time being or move-out .
__label__Negative	thanks for great facility and professional staff . hope to back onboard once covid19 settles ... whenever that happens .
__label__Neutral	we just submitted request as create restaurants ny is deemed essential under relevant regulations and guidelines and following is what we received after submitting . submission was made through `` contact support '' as that is where we were directed to once we clicked on `` essential business '' .
__label__Neutral	i want to cancel my membership or downgrade to one person office as my employees wo n't come in to office given coronavirus pandemic .
__label__Neutral	i will be working from home till time situation around covid-19 is under control . mostly through month of april
__label__Neutral	thanks for getting back to me . i we are signed on through august but our company has been hit very hard by current circumstances . i was hoping could be some flexibility on our membership terms . it will be struggle for us to continue with our current agreement.can you let me if wework is able to any accomodations ?
__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because 's essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they 're taking hit . 's government order to stay inside so we ca n't use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st
__label__Neutral	this company represents parents of students with special needs protected under individuals with disabilities education act . many of families ( clients of member ) are low income families who are n't able to pay firm at this time which has lead to limited cash flow . they could use reduced rent so firm can stay running and pay employees .
__label__Positive	great experience covid19 is just taking me out of town .
__label__Negative	it ’ s actually ironic that you talk about “ covid support ” while wework wants to charge us for not returning keys since our contract with you is expiring today.we ’ ve been asked to and i am quoting “ go to postal offices ” otherwise we will be charged hundred pounds per key.this is really shameful just hope you are aware of that .
__label__Negative	i understand these are unprecedented times and is major impact on wework like companies renting space . that said approach here has shown zero leniencies . your costs are down as it relates to us not being able to send people to office and yet our costs have not been addressed . i ’ ll let samiksha continue to manage communication on our behalf . but as you raise this up to upper management please with approach here showing no compromise combined with lack of focus to right-size our space over last 6 months we 've lost confidence in wework . this leads me to tell you as of now without changes on behalf of our board we will 100 % not be renewing at end of our term . i hope this position changes as your stance does but please accept this as notice if not .
__label__Neutral	please detail my companies financial exposure if we choose to move out on thursday 4/30 . have let them what they 'd be responsible for per ma
__label__Positive	this survey has bugs on number/range selector questions and questions are likely to produce negative/skewed results . we 're very thankful to have had caring community team and we look forward to rejoining community once covid-19 circumstances allow us to all work safely .
__label__Neutral	it 's first time i 've worked in wework and it was brilliant . biscuits galore tea coffee and events ! staff are really friendly and i loved general feel of place . unfortunately because of coronavirus i am unable to come in as i am wfh but it was wonderful experience thank you .
__label__Negative	i suggest you listen to governor of nyc and nj . we are instructed to stay home
__label__Negative	due to covid and nyc issues we will not be able to move items on 4/30 and i have asked repeatedly for guidance as to how we are expected to move out when city will be on shutdown . please advise and call me at 215-280-0844 thank you
__label__Negative	charging members rent during coronavirus . have been told to stay at home by government but you still insist on charging us rent . disgusting behavior .
__label__Negative	we are in shibuya tokyo.yesterday wework shibuya decided to stop drinking services cause of corona virus . please give us something to drink or discount rent fee.i am very angry ! ! ! ! !
__label__Neutral	will not grow like they tought they would reducing size of team
__label__Negative	i am very concerned about wework being open during this covid crisis when our state has mandated that we stay at home . i do n't think it 's responsible to have cleaning and community crews in every day to service an otherwise empty building . should also be rent forgiveness program given current situation given so many of your members are small businesses .
__label__Neutral	as small nonprofit we 're looking to cut costs where we can and i wanted to see if we 're able to reduce our rent or what it would look like to cancel.some quick notes about org./our team adventure project 501c3our mission is to lift people out of extreme poverty through job creation ( currently our programs are in africa ) after cutting salaries and running our financial projections since covid- 19 we 're looking at 3 - 6 months left of operational runway . this is just for us to survive- we also owe close to $ 200k to our program partners by end of 2020.our founder is 8 months pregnant and has dengue fever ( something that compromises your immune system and stays with you always after getting it ) so we 're obviously not using office currently.notes about our lease agreement ( attached ) rent = $ 3910/monthwe rent 10 person officeour lease is from august 1 2018 for 36 months.most of our biggest donors are unable to support us at this time because they are having their own financial concerns . we 're applying to government grants and are keeping close eye on other options as they roll out but rent continues to be one of our largest expenses .
__label__Neutral	i was wondering if is way for a.c. to be little less cold on 2nd floor here at 379 w. broadway in ny . after recent warm-up weather has turned deceptively colder making it likelier for people to catch cold especially if office is too cold . with current hysteria over wuhan virus any sneeze is likely to create concern in others even if it is sneeze from an innocent cold . that is why i was wondering if a.c. air can be made tad warmer . thanks .
__label__Negative	thank you for your email but what most members want is not virtual coffee or yoga . paying same rent whilst not using offices at all is killing them including myself . hope to hear from you soon regarding rent and future plan .

__label__Neutral	i should not be charged in march and april . is mandatory order in new york city that non-essential workers can not work from their office . please refund my .
__label__Negative	staff at wework is very friendly and they do organize some cool perks ; however cleanliness of place can use some work . our organization rents big office from wework but floor desks and general area in our office do not cleaned for many days . is dust everywhere ; and given coronavirus situation it would have been great if wework is more cautious of making place clean as well as leave lysol products and hand sanitizers everywhere . thank you . rbc employee
__label__Neutral	potentially staying if covid-19 situation improves . b
__label__Negative	disgusted with your approach to covid and still charging tenants despite `` shelter in place '' regulation.this is horrific .
__label__Negative	reduced one person office to hot desk and working from home due to national and state of nevada laws restricting use due to covid19 . i feel wework should have immediately allowed this reduction and not forced me to pay thru may because i see it as an effort to support wework w/o just leaving- i thought your goal was to help start ups and small businesses . i am disadvantaged wosb who believes in and supports wework summerlin las vegas while putting next to no extra burden on their overhead . )
__label__Neutral	coronavirus life
__label__Negative	i 'd like to if wework has any plans on suspending and crediting membership until crisis is over . we may not be able to back into our offices until may . especially in nyc area . we ca n't pay for space we ca n't use . please advise.what i find interesting is that almost every company that i 'm aware of has made some type of human gesture to help businesses keep . however wework has not . they have stayed open and quite frankly put you all at risk so they are n't in breach of contract for space availability . even if i could to my office and even if i wanted to put myself and others at risk who is coming to meet me ? we are all suffering but this is more than business issue this is human issue . it 's not just bad business it 's bad idea .

__label__Neutral	artie and sebastian i hope you ’ re both keeping well during these difficult times . i ’ m emailing because i received email reminder saying payment for our office will be taken on 1st april . as small e-commerce business i ’ m sure you can appreciate how much we ’ ve been hit by covid-19 pandemic and this rent payment will really affect us . i ’ ve spoken to community team in our building ( 15 bishopsgate london uk ) who have said someone will contact me in due course to discuss this further however i ’ m concerned that this will be too late . speaking to other coo ’ s in my network someone else received response saying `` unfortunately i am unable to stop billing process and any business leniency in regards to freezing membership will be communicated by global leadership team ” . as part of start-up and small business community that have supported wework for number of years i would really appreciate something in return regarding billing for next few months . we work with number of large companies ( facebook amex etc ) who have all relaxed their payment terms or provided other forms of support and it would be great if wework could follow them in this regard ( like hubble are starting to ) .

__label__Negative	with covid dicease and quarentines to have co-work space can be risky inverstment . right now we re paying for 3 work spaces that we are not using . community is nice but investment for an office we ca n't use is very high and we work has been silent and indifferent to costs .

__label__Negative	we have been at our location with varying numbers of offices since our site opened . it is great concept . however of late we have been increasingly dissatisfied and concerned . we were out of toner to print for over month . repeatedly told desk ... oh we ... .would be response . then market went dark for months . we are in an area where is no where to grab soda . now everyones offices have stashes of food and drink . market did show back up recently . now with corona virus and everyone being so cautious ... .one side women restroom was out of soap this week . today other women 's restroom only has paper towels sitting on table where everyone has to pick up entire roll thus touching center and passing germs on that . unacceptable . holder is totally empty of towels . so playing devils advocate that supplier is out of paper towels for that holder pay 10 for holder so we do n't have to cross contaminate ourselves trying to wash our hands ! ! ! ! !

__label__Neutral	thank you for being so helpful . we love new people in our building even though we arent in building because of chinese virus .
__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides

__label__Negative	negatives:1. not enough meetings rooms after phone booths were removed but plenty of empty offices that are locked and not available for use2 . bathrooms do not have toilet seat covers ( very unsanitary especially now with covid-19 pandemic starting to spread to this very county we 're located in ) .positives:1. community team is exceptional . kiersten austefjord adriene matsudaira and lindsey palmer are solely responsible for majority of positives for this score . without them your score would 've been at best 4. they are responsive helpful and have very positive attitudes.2 . amenities and common areas are very well done and comfortable while still providing professional setting for work to be done . 3. location is very good .

__label__Negative	you have treated dock 72 members in most appalling and unprofessional manner . i signed up to be in dock 72 for may 2019. that got delayed and i did not in until october . i moved into an incomplete space without many of promised amenities . all this i could have dealt with - i it ’ s tough setting things up . but your misleading unkind and frankly irresponsible dealing with covid 19 is what has finally finished it for me . never will i recommend this company to anyone for anything .
__label__Neutral	wework team we are in financial industry and we will require access to our wework space throughout shelter in place period . i ’ ve also submitted support request per below e-mail but i also wanted to follow up directly via e-mail . what else do we need to do to ensure access ?
__label__Neutral	my finance department at fever hq has asked me to reach out to you about negotiating terms of our wework lease for april and may as i 'm sure many companies are doing at moment . first does wework plan on extending rent freezes to your tenants given covid-19 situation ? please let me what plan is on your end . fever is asking for each of our markets - new york los angeles and chicago - to postpone payment of our april and may rent payments . as you our business is in live events space and unfortunately this is having major effect on our company worldwide . do you think this would be possible ? keeping in mind that landscape may change and we may be able to return to office sooner than june and that we have plans to expand to more markets this year and continue to stay in weworks for future markets as well . let me your thoughts and if postponement is possible .

__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming charge ” and am truly disgusted nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job. ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors may continue to go to their jobs.weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential business . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has been shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive orders we can through this and be back to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making choices in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well being during this horrific pandemic .
