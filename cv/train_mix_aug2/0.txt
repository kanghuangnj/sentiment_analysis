__label__Neutral	i plan to return once covid-19 settles down .
__label__Neutral	 w ager to freeze or defer payment for least 2 months
__label__Negative	i we work has its own financial issues to contend with as that has played out in national media but i think some covid discount or refund for april when we are not allowed to use space would be nice gesture . we work was designed for start-up 's `` on edge '' and most of us have had to incur additional costs at home . i my org could really use extra funds . we have deferred any training income to our own partners to help them better serve their youth .
__label__Neutral	leaving due to covid - year 19 lock -down and a government - arranged repatriation to his home - country ( now canada ) .
__label__Neutral	guys if we are being told from our state and city not to go into wework.. are you crediting any charges occurred during this mandated quarantine ?
__label__Neutral	also based on federal guideline and city order i think it ’ s possible that 4/1 move in is impractical . can we defer move date ?

__label__Positive	thanks for constant and continue ongoing communication on building status in their connection to coronavirus . weekly freebies from different vendors to carefully sample new stuff are great , along with other activities coordinated by the community staff staff ! community staff actions are very both helpful and friendly .
__label__Negative	 service is poor . even before cov id responses all service issues were a lack of better phrase something a 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand central office concepts . retrieving mail or packages was always hassle ( they would not find things ) . sound proof ing is nonexistent - zero privacy for all matters especially for conference rooms . also during cov id -- zero offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate office . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cance lling my contract and finding new space .
__label__Negative	i liked everyone here . location of my particular desk was odd in this weird mezzanine thing that involved too many doors and security swipes to to coffee . coronavirus does n't help desire to go to shared coworking space .
__label__Neutral	it would be great to keep in touch when crisis with covid-19 is over . thank you for everything !
__label__Negative	reason i gave lower marks office that i wish frosting on windows went up - too much visibility into our office which can compromise confidentiality . some companies on our floor use shared space for what are obviously lengthy internal meetings . i strongly feel that ending coffee and beer service and honesty market is an overreaction virus situation . cleanliness and common . now we have to go out to to convenience stores and coffee shops - wastes and we with lot more people .
__label__Neutral	until the covid 19 situation stabilises we are not in position today to be able not to be pay carbon for the office space that we are currently not using

__label__Positive	i will return thing gets over .
__label__Negative	your company also does not have value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen not to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from squeezing us . during covid - 19 pandemic , you have not conceded any of your membership fees and in fact you suggested that we expose our staff to virus by sending them to office because wework was ` ` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense ' ' pretense being that majority share of their staff locations remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you only want to squeeze us for few nickels now you ' ve lost potential for any possible future dollars with us .
__label__Positive	i will be right back . i love it . just need virus going to get under control .
__label__Neutral	we are to retain wemembership or two so that we can hold an event which was planned but cancelled due to novel coronavirus issue which was very unfortunate .
__label__Negative	i ’ m sure you ’ ve had similar response to your email such as following . we ’ re now far down nation and told to self isolate and not travelto non essential workplace . and so desk rents i and many have rented have been rendered useless . as dictated by our government we need to practice self isolation to protect ourselves protect others and protect us citizens why are wework members doing anything about meetings to help members who are rendered home bound and working remotely by freezing desk rents until these restrictions are lifted ? ! ? this is utterly disgusting and unfair . many other members are making lot of noise about this injustice on various groups not least because it reflects badly on wework as company and its practices . please send out communication messages addresses concern of most of wework members with fair and satisfactory resolution .
__label__Neutral	its been very pleasant to work with wework . however due to coronavirus situation we are avoiding to be in public spaces we will be back once situation will be more settle

__label__Neutral	your email was very nice and heart touching but a real issue about what aid we actually are to to assist companies with cashflow in these difficult times . do you file business rates declarations on our behalf if you our accountant says whether we have any of these we can possibly claim grants . are they to offer us rent reductions or payment holidays to help them with ?
__label__Negative	terrible handling of covid food and soil contamination with no fish tracing efforts and constant cleaning into the meeting spaces in between .
__label__Negative	i have enjoyed my inexperience at wework until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . for me option to be able to hot desk in other locations differ one of main perks and something i will miss . for me crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to expose its members and back - line employees to risk were deal breakers .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus .
__label__Negative	i offered to downgrade to hot desk and was refused because i was in quarantine and notified after march 1st would not accommodate critical infrastructure business after being exposed to covid by wework employee . now i am leaving all together .
__label__Negative	lack of flexibility releasing us from our contract during onset of covid-19 will have us thinking twice about return to wework .
__label__Negative	wework has shown no flexibility with recent covid-19 pandemic and impact it has on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance they receive from employer and world health organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and member agreements should have flexibility . at this point not sure i would return to wework when all this is over .
__label__Negative	 i hope you ' re both doing well and keeping safe . i ' m not quite sure what all i need to escalate this to as i would really prefer an honest answer to my question vs canned copy / paste response . based on latest update from council and continued order by governor baker we are requesting we work to waive reduce or defer rent in light of this situation . it seems to me we work is trying to maintain that it ' s business as usual and quite frankly this is fool ing no one . this is n t usual for anyone and we need partners like we work to recognize this and accommodations to its policies . just as you are taking precautions to modify your staffing i are doing same it ' s about doing right thing which not trying to put profits before people . please let me who we can talk to about this . regards sk p . s . we ' re apparently are n 't only ones who are disappointed in this situation . it ' s really quite sad what has happened in new y ork i wish we work employees are recovering .

__label__Positive	i ' ll be when back covid 19 is clear
__label__Neutral	our team stops communicating remotely because we understand all of covid - 19 pande blast .
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus was reasonable . here in nyc people are not required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors were locked and i can easily break in and willingly increase infection risk for both my family and others .
__label__Negative	so i guess you were on spring break beaches of florida - it is ok to congregate . i am shocked by these emails ? ? .
__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in on lockdown yet would n ' t let negotiate out of our upcoming set to start on april 1st . by law we ' re not supposed go in to office so we ca n ' t even use space ourselves or our employees . we asked if we at downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said . only thing offered us was trying lock us into one year commitment .
__label__Positive	i enjoyed my stay at wework very much as it is coming to nearly 3 years i also did have some ups and downs in where wework was not meeting standards above all . i have enjoyed every single moment in wework and above i certainly will be seeing you again once corona virusvirus infection has settled and business runs back to normal . thank you for everything you will eventually be missed very much . kind regards hari b .huva

__label__Positive	we had great skills at town square construction work and loved it . due a co [MASK] - 19 i first was n ' ed comfortable using shared space . then we had to shut down our start up due to covid - 19 so we could not pay for space . i would definitely use it again right future under better economic and health circumstances .

__label__Neutral	due to coronavirus - company downsizing
__label__Positive	thanks to persistent efforts - covid19 is lame .
__label__Negative	this differ nonsense ! so you send your team homes but keep doors open for others when you they disinherit not be . this smells like bs to keep companies paying rent . you will have no companies left at this rate guys ! give companies rent free period if everyone is at home .
__label__Neutral	i ’ m not able to fill anything out when i open link . my company resources mtk is staffing / recruitment company we and have people working currently out . i don ’ t need to be office everyday but do need access to office . certainly i don ’ t want people to have to be on site just for my occasional access is however for it possible me to have access building to needed if .
__label__Negative	poorly designed open space area staff ca n't speak english stop providing drinks because of coronavirus - how is this any helpful ? ! saving costs not life ... about office itself cheap chairs and desks . in one of wework buildings party on community are was so loud that i could n't focus at work inside office space ...

__label__Positive	rags secure and i ' ll associates backward once this entire covid 19 business is gone ! greetings again !
__label__Negative	i am not happy with how our wework cope with covid19 . members are still forced to pay for membership potentially leading to people wanting to stand back up to wework against almost all professional medical advises . i am disappointed by ww ' s inflexibility to adapt to pandemic crisis - which also is the reason why i wo ' n ' t return to wework even after crisis is gone .
__label__Neutral	nothing . co .

__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our desks and equipment in place until 9/30 . that way you it easier for us to move back and re-contract with you once covid-19 resolves . if we do not come back by 9/30 return security deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Negative	! think i it would good be to ladies leave toilet ( doors 5f ) to open reduce knob holding and lower of risk passing / getting . virus . cheers

__label__Neutral	 i plan to return when everybody settles out .
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and willingly increase infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Neutral	dear wework team i am writing this email in light of recent worldwide events and circumstances surrounding covid-19 . i was hoping we would not have to resort to this but our company elite sales and services ( gvb ) has experienced an extreme reduction in workload and revenue as vast majority of our clients have been forced to shut down and freeze operations . given that state of california has implemented shelter in place policy and that we are not allowed to resume our regular operations at wework we would like to find way to relieve our financial burden while at same time maintain our responsibilities owed to wework . by means of this email we would like to ask that you postpone or reduce our rent due for months of april and may . we have been large customer of wework for some time and would greatly appreciate support in these trying times . it is of extreme importance to our company to maintain relationship we have built with wework and that we are able to continue our operations after our nation has surpassed this unexpected blow . we are hoping that we are able to come to an understanding where both elite sales and wework are able to find mutual grounds during these difficult times . please feel free to reach out to me directly . looking forward to your response .

__label__Neutral	will i be able to early terminate my lease or will wework freeze my due to covid 19 work from home regulations ?
__label__Negative	organization is so unorganized . i have dedicated desk and they have no way of knowing who has what desk and they randomly assign desks and ca n't even keep track of them . i am most upset with how poorly they have handled covid 19 and am planning on switching to work space that takes public health seriously .
__label__Neutral	will be decided post covid19

__label__Neutral	i will be working remote until covid-19 is resolved
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space . good immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been hold to . here is option we would want . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out . if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this . we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer . please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24 - forty eight hours .
__label__Neutral	dear mathieu and covi support team at wework further to email below we have not had any response so we assume you have accepted our rent holiday request . we really appreciate your help in these difficult and uncertain moments . thanks and regards carmen .
__label__Neutral	can i ask your assistance on an urgent matter . as i am making sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is still not going to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions / potential recessions happening in the market . i need to some facts / figures fairly urgently as stated i am putting worst case contingency plans in place . we currently have lease that ends in approximately july / august 2013 and monthly rental $ 12 , 257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space . while stated i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what then would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this ' ' [ cm team responded with policy ]
__label__Negative	i really enjoy lot of things about wework and i love weekly events as well ! my biggest feedback ( only because of corona virus scare ) is cleanliness of door handles and areas that are frequently touched like microwave fridge bathroom doors water filter buttons etc . i think handles of objects have to be cleaned more frequently because you can see fingersprints on these when they are dirty . also people are constantly leaving wework cups in bathroom and it 's kind of gross . i think we work guests should not be allowed to wework cups or mugs into bathroom if other members use these cups as well . ( no fault to cleaning team at all on these they are best ! )
__label__Positive	it has been amazing and i was very sad to have retiring due to covid - inc .
__label__Negative	i 'm member across various contracts and have been big fan of wework.you are completely neglecting biggest concern and mood that members have and it ’ s not doing you any favours at all.wework members are actually all on private slack channel talking and planning mass direct debit cancellation and termination . they are also talking to journalists too . this is because of fact you aren ’ t communicating on rent issue while they are struggling.walking around some of wework buildings i can see people have already started moving out en mass too.what ’ s it to for wework to show it ’ s members some courtesy ? if you don ’ t want complete revolt from members i ’ d strongly suggest better response is sent out today to show you really do care about struggles they are all facing now .

__label__Negative	my experience with wework has been very good . my frustration is regarding wework 's covid policy . due to regulations in our state we have not used our space for weeks and likely wo n't for next month . these are extraordinary circumstances and i would have expected more cooperation with tenants to work on pausing accounts while we are enduring such financial distress . i was told that office remains open so we will be charged .
__label__Neutral	given covid-19 how can we arrange to keep all personal belongings and computers in storage or set-aside until we can come back to them ?
__label__Neutral	i ca n't use building right now because of covid19

__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to covid-19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i 'm korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between those hours.also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work.the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels.the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and ammedities are good.lastly employees at wework do n't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .
__label__Positive	community managers were wonderful . thanks sai dana karizma taylor all and we . hope we can back come after of all covid this - non sense .
__label__Negative	whole coronavirus replaces creating lot of uncertainty and and as business is newly created one i do n't feel like noting exorbitant prices of wework when government most liable announces soon no one should go to work used people remain home . . .
__label__Negative	everything about how wework has handled this covid system has been poorly managed . in weeks leading up to full closure / closure was not single hand - sanitizer jar to be found in our offices . bathroom was routinely out of papertowels . one like those in women ' s restroom has n ' t worked since we moved in late last year . you ' ve continued to your work go in when things were getting worse . i had conversation with some of cleaning folks and they were genuinely afraid for their health but did n ' t want to lose their job . now we are banned from working and you are trying to turn us into 12 month lease ? and it ' s taking you weeks to figure out how to improve our situation ( and i ' m sure everyone else is in same boat here ) . meanwhile answer should look pretty obvious . other co - working spaces have paused agreements but you ' re still trying to squeeze out any last dollar in last ditched effort at self - preservation . while we loved staff at our location and loved product in good times mismanagement during bad times are enough to force us to look elsewhere when this is all stabilized .
__label__Positive	work environment is great and staff be real positive helpful and professional . kaitlyn herzog is do fantastic job especially given current saint elmo's light computer virus situation .

__label__Neutral	home office during time being . until guys pick up anew levels covid19 is under control
__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .
__label__Neutral	only thing that ’ s bothers me is al of this that is happening right now.. but otherwise as my job had to closed because of virus ’ s for our health i feel good in my posible ways
__label__Negative	again brand will be remembered by how they acted during covid . it ’ s unlikely you ’ ll repair damage done if you can not act quickly during this time .
__label__Positive	i will definitely repatriated once covid thing evolves over .
__label__Negative	wework is breeding ground for spreading disease particularly in state/city where people continue to ignore safety measures put in place by state government . this is irresponsible to say least . stop putting your financial interests before human lives . conscience and close your locations for god ’ s sake .

__label__Negative	 ine ffect ively disconnected & un responsive response to the crisis
__label__Negative	why do n't you allow me to freeze until covid situation is clear
__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it 's clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men 's room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high.the water bottle/fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands.the general sentiment from office to our office manager is when are we moving ?
__label__Negative	frankly disappointed that no suspension scheme available during this virus outbreak and most facilities and events are suspended and cancelled basically forced to pay but nothing is provided .

__label__Negative	you should explore being able to allow person to remain their desk locations in data for keeping service retainer ( just stopping monthly pursuant ) or keeping small monthly fee running to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i i . e . covid19 ) . i i think that would show some loyalty to your members which they clubs return caused you whereas just alternative i described is to terminate my membership .

__label__Negative	i too am sorely disappointed with just how wework and london handled over this whole matter by dragging on their feet - and coming running back with less than standard empathetic offers , in spite of covid19 extraneous circumstances .
__label__Negative	i assume it is more like request to building company instead of wework but it would be great if you could provide paper towels at rest room since air towel is out of service from corona virus .

__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space.effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to.here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out.if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this.we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer.please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24-48 hours .

__label__Neutral	i just received this update however it does not outline wework 's policies for non-essential business . due to extreme uncertainty of what is to come next and how long will government shutdown last until i would strongly request wework management to not charge non-essential business until is further clarity on situation . if possible please provide us with confirmation before end of this month on whether or not wework will continue to charge non-essential businesses for unused space . i hope during this time of uncertainty we can continue to build more meaningful relationship with wework . look forward to hearing from you asap .

__label__Neutral	asking downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020 * * hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office . we unfortunately have to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra we had initially anticipated . the situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays at current level . the additional space is very much to be surplus to requirements so wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not be able to use space for foreseeable future . i that we have contract until july so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would much appreciated . i look forward to hearing back you . bestleon devereux

__label__Negative	you should explore being able to allow person to retain their desk space in return for keeping service retainer ( just stopping monthly payments ) or keeping small monthly fee running to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i.e . covid19 ) . i think that would show some loyalty to your members which they would return to you whereas only alternative i have is to terminate my membership .

__label__Negative	when will leadership provide any information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such we can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices today ( which we have ca n ' t do again due to lockdown ) . i ' ve just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup and fees ( which we have n ' t actually been setup and we can not move to or use due to lockdown ) . this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not actually use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has also had our revenue destroyed by virus as well . we have been in close touch with our community team ( who is also cc ' d ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership . it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else gets screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework ' ' s occupancy rate record and financial health . i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .

__label__Neutral	covid-19 impact on our business
__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid-19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no-reply @ wework.com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche.io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) .but i was little disappointed to see today - i felt ok coming here during pandemic b/c not lot of people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .

__label__Negative	i really enjoy of lot things about wework and i love weekly events as well ! my biggest feedback ( only because of virus corona scare ) is cleanliness of door and handles areas that are frequently touched like microwave fridge bathroom doors water filter buttons . etc i handles think of objects have to be cleaned more frequently because you can see fingersprints on when these they are dirty . also people are constantly leaving wework cups in bathroom and it ' s kind of gross . we i think work guests should not be allowed to wework cups or mugs into if bathroom other members use these as cups well . ( no fault to cleaning team at all on these they are best ! )

__label__Neutral	not taking away all amenities during corona virus feels like a completely transparent cost saving measure . maybe you can milk at conbini house but not here ? really ? no solid ice maybe makes sense but no hot coffee or market is far beyond necessary . other than that the place was basically great . staff is also incredible !

__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear back from building management . and yes information technology ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non - essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move - out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to me they could be considered an “ essential ” business … on related note were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to personify further work done in come days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current condition . lastly please keep me post once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously state i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality … many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and effort . institutionalize my best grant

__label__Negative	although i depreciate this may not be your area we are tenant in 10 york road and as of today we have not had any meaningful contact from anyone at wework to how company will be passing on governments assistance to its tenants . given enormity of issue i weakly recommend wework inactivity to help sme ' s & freelancers or you wo n ' t have any companies left to occupy offices on their return .
__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am ordered to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment . as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this provision on of any delay or failure to perform as expected under this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance . the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and it appears that it will do so for an indefinite effect particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter - on - place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our workers and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting us obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of us employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to abandon any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during recovery period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020 . please confirm . thank you . best katie
__label__Positive	send up your work ! virus trials pass . we will all be stronger soon . "

__label__Negative	i have enjoyed my experience at wework until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . for me option to be able to hot desk in other locations was one of main perks and something i will miss . for me crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to expose its members and front-line employees to risk were deal breakers .
__label__Negative	well i 'll say it again . i do not think it is very neighborly or decent of y'all to uphold 30 day move out policy for folks that have been laid off as direct result of covid-19 . especially when they cant even legally utilize that office space at this time .

__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to service issues were for lack of better phrase something that 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during covid -- zero offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cancelling my contract and finding new space .

__label__Negative	stop sending me template you probably send to all `` non-essential '' businesses asking you same questions and give us some real answers . why is n't rent freeze for businesses who legally can not work out of your offices . if you 're to stay open for essential businesses who are actually supporting this crisis i think that 's great . but businesses who legally can not access your buildings due to global pandemic are getting screwed by you . good job showing your true colors wework . we 're definitely moving to another office share once our lease is up . one that actually cares about physical and financial health of their members .
__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email . i had been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day when prime minister johnson asked people to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only feedback i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast . it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co - working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time . additionally wework are not delivering as many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t enjoy yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs fulfilled . i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks . a few months later i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent wages . i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency . you owe your business better than this .

__label__Negative	since working from home due to covid i can see how much better it is . i need to one or two confidential calls day and absolutely can ’ t do that from wework ! surely sound proof phone booths is basic requirement for office space . also i gave up tryjng to printing to work . helpdesk tried to help but it never got resolved and shouldn ’ t have been tricky . sign up process was nightmare with multiple emails demanding payment which turned out ( when i questioned them ) to be wrong . overall very unprofessional experience . even trying to fill out this form took 4 browsers across two devices to eventually find ststem on wgich this form worked

__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and good spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours.based on nature of our business ( face-to-face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay off employees and close our offices in nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer need these office spaces.i 'm sure given nature of weworks work this is also not an ideal time for you all and i 'm sure you have bunch of different things on as far as managing this nightmare.so for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due to `` shelter-in-place '' order they 've closed office to all `` non-essential businesses '' in philly due to confirmed covid-19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening date.after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to reopen spaces we have with wework . however we need to cancel our memberships in those spaces asap.is way to immediately cancel membership to those spaces for april billing cycle or what exceptions are you making for times in which shared coworking spaces are regulated out of our control by government ?

__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n't let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we 're not supposed to go in to office so we ca n't even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us was trying to lock us into one year commitment .
__label__Negative	this is nonsense ! so you send your team homes but keep doors open for others when you they will not be . this smells like bs to keep companies paying rent . you will have no companies left at this rate guys ! give companies rent free period if everyone is at home .

__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter.as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions/ potential recessions in market.i need to some facts/ figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place.we currently have lease that ends in approximately july/ august and monthly rental $ 12,257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space.while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this '' [ cm team responded with policy ]
__label__Negative	in normal circumstances my rating might be higher but i think you ' ve chosen seriously odd time to ask for feedback given we ca n ' t work in your offices during lockdown unless we want to increase our chances of end coronavirus . i think you should give businesses discount while they ca n ' t use your services .

__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .

__label__Negative	i ’ m not happy w coronavirus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your staff yet told us we can keep coming to work even though you that we are mandated to stay home during this crisis . in your carelessness you may have even caused more contamination all in service of still collecting rent.i noticed that on very first day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank acct . we are small business and i really think your actions are irresponsible and not community-oriented.since you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn ’ t ring true.i suggest given we can ’ t use our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely
__label__Negative	iin general wework building is lovely and so are staff . my only concern has been toilets . very often would be no soap or hand towels and one of taps on floor 2 does n't work . pretty frustrating with covid outbreak .

__label__Negative	dear wework team we have been users of your product for some time and have loved experience . but in past few weeks our small business has taken major hit . if we can not cut costs we will have major chance of shutting down . wework represented for us 80 % of our costs as we just upgraded our plan and got closed office for 3. we tried to cancel but we are forced to pay two full months and we wo n't see our deposit only in few months . we are requesting that you consider refunding us for month of april and give us back our deposit . we have been loyal customers for while but we did not any use out of product for this period and if not for strictly cutting costs we may not be able to return to using your product in future . i hope you understand and ’ s something you can do to help our situation .

__label__Negative	so if we 're not essential and ordered to stay at home are you providing refunds for rent ? i 'm not sure why we should be paying if we are n't allowed to come in and front desk staff is n't even working anymore nor can we packages or mail .
__label__Positive	thank you for keeping your facilities open at this time . i have been using my wework office as it is safer than my home for work .
__label__Neutral	is relief any that provide wework could during us this time ? what our general suggested counsel upon our reviewing was contract postpone to our monthly payments for time period of with commitment from us that we ' d then add those months to extend our lease when it runs out ( mar / apr 2021 ) .
__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment.as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance.the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and it appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter-on-place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020.please confirm . thank you.best katie

__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and low spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours . based on nature of our business ( face - on - face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay off employees and close our offices in nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer offer these office spaces . i ' m sure given nature of weworks work this is also not an ideal time for you all and i ' m sure we have bunch many different things on as far as managing this nightmare . both for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due to ` ` shelter - in - place ' ' order they ' ve closed office to all ` ` non - essential businesses ' ' in philly due to confirmed covid - 19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening date . after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to reopen spaces we have with wework . however we need to cancel our membership elsewhere in these spaces asap . is way to immediately cancel membership to those responsible for april billing cycle or what exceptions are you making for times in which shared coworking spaces are regulated independently of our control by government ?

__label__Neutral	wework like probably majority of your community members i am running small start - up business from office space i rent from wework . coronavirus has hit our cashflow hard and we are now in fight for survival of business . in meantime we are still paying rent for expensive office space that is empty as all my staff are working from home . one of my team had to go into our building briefly yesterday and said it was most entirely empty so most occupiers are in similar position . please can you confirm what wework is to do to support your community of small business / start - up tenants through this unprecedented time ? not only are we as tenants all paying for service we ca n ' t use without support is very real risk could be no wework community very soon as businesses either go bust or chose to default on their rent . i ca n ' t imagine it would be in wework ' s commercial interests to allow that to hap . one wait forward to your response .

__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020**hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated.the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays at current level.the additional space is very much to be surplus to requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able to use space for foreseeable future.i that we have contract until july so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated.i look forward to hearing back from you.bestleon devereux
__label__Neutral	no safety issues just not using the space engines during the covid - 19 shutdown .
__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .

__label__Neutral	dear wework team i am writing this email in light of recent worldwide events and circumstances surrounding covid - 19 . i was hoping we would not suddenly have to resort to this but our company elite sales and services ( gvb ) has experienced an extreme reduction in workload and revenue as vast majority of our clients have been forced to shut down and freeze operations . given that state of california has implemented shelter in place policy and that we are not allowed to resume our regular operations at the wework we would like to find way forward to relieve our financial burden while at same time maintain our responsibilities owed to wework . by means of this email we would like to ask that you postpone or reduce our rent due for months instead of april and may . granted we have been large customer of wework for some time and would greatly appreciate your support in these trying times . it is also of extreme importance to our company also to maintain relationship we have built with wework and that we are able somehow to continue our operations after our nation has surpassed this unexpected blow . we are hoping that someday we are able to come to an understanding where both elite sales and wework are able to find mutual grounds during these difficult times . please feel free to reach out to me directly . looking forward to your response .

__label__Neutral	what cleaning measures differ you guys taking in regards of coronavirus ?
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to severalise you how concerned i am in wework ' s current statement of insurance . california is under state - wide fiat from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid - 19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate . . . and so this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter / hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for ` ` essential business organisation ' ' than stipulation that only businesses that are ` ` essential ' ' - i . e . ` ` healthcare policy cleaning supplies as you state ' ' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as floor effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .

__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to lose our desks and equipment in place until 9 / 30 . that way you it difficult for us to move back and re - contract with you once covid - 19 irresoluteness . if we do not come back by 9 / 30 return insecurity deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Negative	thank you for your email and i reciprocate hopes that you and yours are safe and healthy in this very difficult time . it is indeed very challenging for all of us and will hopefully not last too long . as to wework 's position on collection of our rent which i 'm certain is corporate decision and not an individual position on your part i have to point out again that we are under stay at home order by state of california . it is not legal for us to do business in wework facility at present time nor by extension is it legal for you to allow us to do so as non-essential business . wework 's `` obligation to our members to stay open for those that do rely on our space to operate as business and to those essential businesses who are still coming into our office as they are actively fighting covid '' does not apply to stride management and does not supersede fact that we are prohibited from doing business . clearly concept of prorated relief on rent has already been agreed to by wework as demonstrated by your decision to prorate rent when offices were unavailable due to recent cleaning . now again wework offices are unavailable to us and can not be used by our company . accordingly please suspend all automatic ach rent payments from stride to wework immediately and until this crisis has passed and stay at home order has been lifted by state . i am happy to discuss further with you or any other wework representative . i can be reached at 310-601-6792 .

__label__Negative	due to recent shut down in ny due to covid-19 of non-essential business it is presumed that wework will be pro-rating our monthly rent for month of march and until such time as we have clearance that we are permitted to return to office from federal state or local government . kindly inform us of what if any paperwork is necessary to be completed to receive proper credit . if any paperwork is needed kindly forward it to my attention . if direct credit will be applied please inform accordingly . thanking you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter . i ’ d like to discuss my with someone . state of ca and city of los angeles have mandated that we stay home and not venture out into public spaces and workplace . other companies we have relationships and monthly contracts with have suspended march and april rent payments and they will re-access for may . we tried to go to our office on saturday and parking garage was closed . we were forced to park on street and subsequently received parking ticket . once inside building bathrooms had not been cleaned and floors were dirty . our facility is not being cleaned and measures are not being taken to clean and sanitize any more than they have in past . mandate from federal government is to stay away from public spaces and we feel that wework isn ’ t designed to support this mandate . i ’ d like to talk to someone about getting credit for march as well as not paying for future months until this virus and global pandemic is behind us . furthermore financial hardship of having this payment each month that we can ’ t work out of is to be painful . please advise .
__label__Neutral	i have greatly enjoyed wework and it 's been an incredible experience . staff other residents facilities . and i hope to return . but for now i 'm leaving with hope that by not being in communal space all day i have better chance of not catching virus or at least delaying spread . thanks !

__label__Positive	community team is exceptional and your inflexibility during covid pandemic was first class .
__label__Neutral	we are member of london marks square community and as i ’ m sure you are aware uk government regulations are stating that people remain at home and are only permitted out for essential activities . strict regulations currently in place in uk mean that we are not in position to use facilities/services at marks square . we are an ngo with added complication that it takes us about year to claim vat back on wework fee and next 6 months will be putting an economic strain on our operations.i have been trying to find out for some time now what support you/wework will be giving us in respect of our membership fees . similar organisations to yourself are providing rent relief to support their members through these very difficult times.please can someone back to me as matter of urgency .
__label__Negative	 What we work is a place and structure to work fact that these locations have not shut down ( unlike locations where they had outbreaks ) seem both irresponsible and incons ider ate to both employees as well the those who would ever return to the unsafe environment .
__label__Neutral	 im i reside in city and rarely commute into city … i am no longer able to travel so . what are protocols for snail mail or rent ? since i am able to travel and my business had been affected nothing is being done about rent ?

__label__Negative	 i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from we work then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and over reaching this office closure is . we work is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . we work does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of cov , contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be allowed . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical employee events posting which i generally ignore expectations of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have sc rip ref illed today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an ep igil they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be entitled to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to we work gas tower environment between march 6 th and march 18 th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable . what is of far greater concern to me is that it is obvious . that you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or respond to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by stagger ingly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is � � no - reply @ we work . com � � notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6 th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche . io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in cal if ornia so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Negative	your company does not value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from us . during covid-19 pandemic you have not conceded any of your membership fees and in fact suggested that we expose our staff to virus by sending them to office because wework was `` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense '' pretense being that majority of their locations remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze us for few nickels now you 've lost potential for any future dollars with us .

__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in-house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april.besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in-office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote.as situation is progressing we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .

__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014 . three months ago i would have given wework 9 . but i believe response to covid virus been has insufficient . wework should give people on break rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so however . having listened to podcast wecrashed it due seems largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were ` ` ' upgraded 1 ' - 2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you like are president us of we ca n ' t believe what you say .

__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores there or hospitals . therefore your business is non - essential and so are companies who call wework home . t to mention that you recently had 3 cases of under - 19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put individuals ’ s health and well - being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed contracts for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . although i ’ m sure if you reached word to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would appreciate your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Negative	 after reaching out months ago about clean liness issues ( and repeatedly before that ) and trying to go to month at our current rent rate we were issued with much resistance and sort of `` too bad '' response . even despite good service we decided to go month to month while agreeing to an increase in our rent . then on march 16 we submitted request to landlord based on cov id above and concerns concerns about shared workspace continued issues with clean liness etc . we were only offered relief if we engaged in work contract to long term agreement . a bad policy coming in time like this . feels very much like opportun izing in time of crisis . seems ironic for company that is supposed to foster strong practices of community care to be so un support ive in current state . e vey time in past several weeks that we we work email i think this must be any adjustment policy or pause in membership etc . but it has never come . we have very bad taste from this `` wizard of oz '' answers always where people working at tower 49 said they did n 't have authority and would send an email request to those higher ups . we are exiting immediately . upon stay at home mandate being over we will collect our items . if anyone would like to reach out to me please feel free to call me at 9 17 - 9 72 - 28 72 .
__label__Neutral	firstly we hope you and all your colleagues are well and safe during this time.at aaron basha it is our upmost priority to protect safety and well-being for all our employees . due to recent news and uncertainty surrounding covid-19 we had made decision to heed warning of federal and local authorities and require our employees to conduct business at home until it is safe for everyone . we are also doing this since our employees rely on ny and nj mass transit to to work.we would like to what concessions wework is currently giving tenants if any . for this reason we are requesting concession and relief in our monthly rent . although wework is giving its members options where to work since is limited staffing we do not feel shared environment is safe .
