__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .

__label__Negative	" when we asked if ' we could end contract at end point of march instead of 20 april given covid - 19 situation , ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' but following government advice in order to potentially save lives . any suggestion we are being overcauti -ous by not using we shouldwork is absurd and it ' s still this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid - 19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just might say that but do n ' t say we ' re being cautious given current crisis .

__label__Negative	only reason i gave blue marks for office is that i wish frosting on windows went up higher - too much visibility into our office which can compromise confidentiality . some company on our floor role shared space for what are apparently lengthy internal meetings . i strongly feel that ending coffee and beer divine service and honesty market is an overreaction to virus state of affairs . cleanliness and common sense should prevail . now we have to go out to to convenience stock and coffee shops - wastes time and we interact with mountain more people .
__label__Negative	wework is already not what it was not because of virus or pre - virus . cleaning staff members and people who coffee have no relationship with members and members are not aware enough of them . member network is dysfunctional . member benefits that are not up to date promoted ( discounts come on goods and services ) or pat of experience . learning events are also not in line with business needs . are less perks . furniture needs more help . community staff is doing more with less and are almost always trying to help .

__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it 's clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men 's room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high.the water bottle/fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands.the general sentiment from office to our office manager is when are we moving ?

__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non-essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid-19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well-being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Positive	hannah and anna at 655 montgomery differ always extremely accommodating . it feels like they differ an extension of our team because they really differ ! back forward to heading back in office post covid 19 quarantine .
__label__Negative	wework has shown no flexibility with recent covid-19 pandemic and impact it has on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance they receive from employer and world health organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and member agreements should have flexibility . at this point not sure i would return to wework when all this is over .
__label__Negative	i ’ m sure you ’ ve had similar response to your email such following as . we ’ re now locked down nation and told to self isolate not and travelto non essential work . and so desks i and many have rented have been rendered useless . dictated as by our government we need to practice self isolation to protect ourselves protect and others protect our nhsso why are wework not doing anything this about help to members who are rendered home and bound working remotely by freezing desk rents until these restrictions are lifted ? ! ? this is utterly ridiculous and unfair . many other members are making lot of noise about this injustice on various not groups least because this reflects badly on wework as company and its practices . please send out which communication addresses concern of most of wework with members fair and satisfactory resolution .
__label__Negative	the virus scare subsides seemingly looking to be back into outer space .

__label__Negative	were certain promises made at time of contract execution that differ not fulfilled . i wish these items would have differ included in contract . is lack of parking . 0 privacy and you can hear everything in office next to you . conference room phones do not work . acoustics in conference rooms are horrible . dirty amid coronavirus was very lack luster . utensils are hand washed and then laid directly on table . our office area is not vacuumed . it is very frustrating to arrive at work at 7 am and not have access to coffee until cleaning crew arrives at 8 : 30 or 9 : 00the first group of employees at wework were very difficult to work with ( adriene matsudaira ) team that now manages our site are great to work with lindsey palmer alexis hesse .

__label__Negative	though discovering good facilities inside fact are not user - friendly slippy floor too bright rooms if they are actual south no control on temperature no drinks / treats served ( due requirements covid - issued ) no vending machine . it might be good to stop under and host guests occasionally but it fails difficult and inefficient to work under here anticipating proper function .

__label__Negative	1. i think that service quality has gone down bit since reorganization of corporate . we always experienced lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated.2 . has been no effort to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this covid crisis.3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4. part of wework 's value prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited to 9am to 6pm this does n't reflect way business is done in nyc . 5. our front desk does n't open until 9am . in normal nyc building desks are staffed 24/7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .

__label__Neutral	since i am not “ essential ” and ordered to stay in place at home in ca will wework be waiving my membership fees during “ shelter in place ” order in ca ?
__label__Negative	i am very concerned about wework being open during this covid crisis when our state has mandated that we stay at home . i do n ' t believe it ' s creditworthy to have cleaning and community crews in every day to service an otherwise empty bellied building . should also be rent forgiveness program given current situation given hence many of your members are small businesses .

__label__Positive	i had great member interaction other than day and i wanted to share it all with y ’ all . i was talking with member of katalyst team who had been working tirelessly to fda approval on their full body ems personal home training system and they ’ ve finally gotten go - ahead ahead . they were originally hoping to launch in april but they ’ ve decided to launch pre - orders early tonight and business is booming ! i mean honestly what better time is to launch such an at - home fitness program than when people are asked to stay home for at least two weeks . it ’ ' s been little difficult staying positive but this convo definitely illuminated that no matter how scary things things may seem , right now life can always be silver - lining . heart : muscle

__label__Neutral	because of virus that we would work at home for , the situation gets worse .
__label__Negative	weeks prior to covid wework was doing nothing to stop its spread . no alcool gel anywhere nothing . they said they sent warning messages to people i didnt receive anything no signs anywhere . this was eminent and coming and nothing was done . i lost all trust in you guys .
__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020 * * hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated . the current putting situation is massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation on carries for too long which is onlygoing be to compounded if rent stays at current level . the additional very space is much to be surplus to requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain is business under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able to use space for foreseeable future i . that we have contract until july so my hope we is can weather storm and revisit something in bigger july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated . i look forward to hearing back from you . bestleon devereux
__label__Negative	that considering we are unprecedented in times corona to virus issue and visiting wework would not be possible / allowed at least for next 3 / 4 weeks time to due restrictions it would great be if wework bill not for & this month next .
__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter . as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions / potential recessions in market . i need to some facts / figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place . we currently have lease that ends in approximately july / august and monthly rental $ 12 , 257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this differ an 18 pax office space . while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing downwardly for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this ' ' [ cm team responded with policy ]
__label__Neutral	covid19
__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .

__label__Neutral	wework like probably majority of your community members i am running small start - up business clients from office space i rent from wework . coronavirus has hit our cashflow hard and we are now in fight for survival of business . in meantime we are still paying rent for expensive office space and that is empty as all my staff are still working from home . one of my team had to go into our building briefly yesterday and said it was almost entirely empty so most o -ccupiers are in similar position . please can you confirm what wework is to do to support all your community of small business / start - up tenants through this unprecedented time ? not only , are we as tenants all paying for service we ca n ' t use without support is very real low risk could be no wework community very soon as businesses either go bust or chose to default on their rent . i ca n ' t imagine it would be in wework ' s best commercial interests to allow that to happen . i look forward to your response . ( i may have already already raised this matter with community team who did n ' t what to say )
__label__Neutral	offices / meeting rooms in san remain open for to ? not wework be membership fees ?
__label__Neutral	as we are faced extra shelter in prison in state financial emergency is we work making concessions on our rent when we are not able to work from our offices ? pushing rent payments to april 15th would be justified as many of our employees are not working as well ; therefore they are having enough pay their invo dollars . please let me .

__label__Neutral	thank you for reaching out and we appreciate all that is being done by wework to assist in these interesting times.a question i have asked wework in both south africa and london ( where we have office ) is whether wework will be sending out some official communication around any potential plans to pass down rental savings or payment holidays in line with some of local government initiatives that are being published . as you can imagine these will be great help for us and many other small business which up such big part of wework ’ s member profile . i had standard company response last week stating we understand that current situation confronts all of us with challenges and wework is dedicated to supporting its members in these unique circumstances . we are working with our leadership team to decide best way to move forward and we will communicate with you all when we more . i am wondering if this is still being looked at ad when we can expect some more information from wework on this.wishing you all best and looking forward to hearing from you .

__label__Negative	i ’ m not happy w coronavirus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your staff however told us we can keep coming issued work even while you that we are mandated to stepped home during this crisis . in your carelessness you may have even caused more contamination all in service of still collecting bills . i noticed that on great first day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank acct . we are small business and i really think your actions are irresponsible and not community - oriented . since you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn ’ t ring true . i suggest given we fucking ’ t uses our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely
__label__Negative	considering that we are in unprecedented times to corona virus issue and visiting wework would not be possible/allowed at least for next 3/4 weeks time due to restrictions it would be great if wework not bill for this & next month .

__label__Positive	 The facilities ! and we work team left 161 castle yesterday - we hope to be able to return after six months are over .
__label__Negative	i 'm deeply disappointed by wework 's refusal to pause contracts in light of covid . as our non-profit faces serious financial crunch wework has thus far been uninterested in sharing hardship .
__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid-19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no-reply @ wework.com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche.io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Neutral	also based on federal guideline and city order i think it ’ s possible that 4/1 move in is impractical . can we defer move date ?
__label__Negative	fwiw - last thing i wanted to do at moment is commit to any length of time i.e . 5 months or 12 months . really felt options provided around covid-19 were poor . have loved being at wework for past 2.5 years and hope to return .
__label__Neutral	i am trying to access recent membership agreement to review it but it keeps taking me to member network and only thing i can find in my settings is billing info . what i 'd like to what is cancellation policy of this membership and what fees would i incur or money i would lose/owe should i cancel my membership ? i am trying to necessary arrangements for my business and weighing all of my business expenses at moment in light of what is on .

__label__Negative	thank you for your email and i reciprocate hopes that you and yours are safe and healthy in this very difficult time . it is indeed very challenging for all of us and will hopefully not last too long . as to stride ' s position on collection of our rent which i ' m writing is corporate decision and not an individual position on your part i have to point out again that we are under stay at home order by state of california . it was not legal for us to do business in wework facility at present time nor by extension is it legal for you to allow us to do so as non - essential business . stride ' s ` ` obligation to our members to fully open for those that do rely on our space to operate as business and to those essential businesses who are still coming into our office as they are actively fighting covid ' ' does not apply to stride management and does not supersede employers that we are prohibited from doing business . clearly concept for prorated relief on rent has already been agreed to by wework as demonstrated by your decision to prorate rent when offices were unavailable due to recent cleaning . now again wework offices are unavailable to us and can not be used by our company . accordingly please suspend all automatic ach rent payments from stride to wework immediately and until this crisis has passed and stay at home order has completely lifted from state . i am happy to discuss further with you or any other wework representative . clearance can be reached at 310 - 601 - 6792 .

__label__Negative	lack of inflexibility releasing us from our contract during onset of covid - 19 will have us forget twice about return to wework .
__label__Negative	though looking good facilities in fact are not user-friendly slippy floor too bright rooms if they are facing south no control on temperature no drinks/snacks served ( due to covid-19 ) no vending machine . it might be good to stop by and host guests occasionally but it is difficult and inefficient to work in here anticipating proper function .

__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .

__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and by content in your email . i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line being inundated with members like me who need answers fast . it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co - working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time . additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact . have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks . a few months ago committed to doubling desk as our company grew . weeks later our is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let go and we ’ re dealing with company charging rent unreasonably . i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency . you owe your members better than this .

__label__Neutral	original request - pre - shelter in place - as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4 . 098 and 4 . 102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4 . 1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ m sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv - 19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise that this is still space which is useful and will continue to differ so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4 . 1 ) however differ different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease . could we lack conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request - post - shelter in place - i ’ m aware of recent announcement in worn york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non - essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non - usage .

__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in-house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april.besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in-office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote.as situation is progressing we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .

__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides

__label__Negative	your company does not value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over . you squeezed us every last penny you could from us . during covid - 19 you not any of your membership fees and in fact suggested that we expose our staff to virus sending them to because wework was ` ` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense ' ' pretense being that majority of their remained open because you supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze for few nickels now you ' ve lost potential for any future dollars with us .

__label__Negative	staff at wework is very friendly and they do organize some cool perks ; however cleanliness of place can use some work . our organization rents big office from wework but floor desks and general area in our office do not cleaned for many days . is dust everywhere ; and given coronavirus situation it would have been great if wework is more cautious of making place clean as well as leave lysol products and hand sanitizers everywhere . thank you . rbc employee

__label__Negative	due to virus issue all service has abstain away . for example no coffee no beer and even food market has closed . i understand risk unrestraint but hope wework hire come down with any alternative service idea .
__label__Negative	 . i think customer service quality has gone down bit since reorgan ization of corporate . we always have lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated . 2 . has been a program to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this cov id crisis . 3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4 . part of we office ' s business prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited from 9 am to 6 pm this does n 't reflect way business is done in n y c . 5 . our front desk does not open until 9 am . in normal n y c building desks are staffed 24 / 7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .
__label__Negative	i work we has its own financial issues to contend with as that has out played in national media but i think some covid discount or refund for april when we are not to allowed use space would be nice gesture . we work was designed for start - ' up s ` on ` edge ' ' and most of us have had to incur costs additional at home i . my org really could use extra funds . we have deferred any training income to our own partners to help them better serve their youth .
__label__Positive	i ' ll be back when covid 19 be percipient

__label__Neutral	coronavirus means home working
__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to service issues were for lack of better phrase something that 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during covid -- zero offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cancelling my contract and finding new space .
__label__Neutral	primary member steve hanshaw informed myself on call that as their company is startup they are not doing well in this economy and does not have funding to pay april 's rent . they really love wework and do not want to leave but he is looking for what his options are for following scenarios:1. immediate move out2 . freeze membership until after covid19 is over3 . giving 2 month notice but still breaking commitment
__label__Negative	wework has no flexibility with recent covid - 19 pandemic impact it on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance from employer and world organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and should have flexibility . this point not sure i would return wework when all this is over .

__label__Neutral	covid-19 reduced wework activities.chances to meet and collaborate with other comapnies are really difficult now.on other hand i really appriciate that wework staffs are keeping rooms clean .
__label__Positive	thank god for seeing the facilities open at this facility . i have enjoyed discussing my wework office as it is safer than the barracks for work .
__label__Positive	 the crew at the 27 - 01 queens plaza n long island city NY 111 01 is missing . i focus on daily life and really hope to be back by Christmas .
__label__Negative	Terrible treatment of tenants covid during 19 - crisis . to continuing charge rent while banning access to buildings is shitty business when especially read i in ft wework that itself is not some paying of its april . rent
__label__Neutral	( thread with member treats very long see next tables invites request ) member doesn ' wanna to break their 2 year undertaking but larvae are ready approached forfeit their sr whereas ` ` sunk cost . ' ' i fucking n ' tonnes see any tools that we have to pause their membership unless we want to offer them 2 months free to try and keep their business .
__label__Neutral	i signed for wework this week to use for rest of month but given recent covid-19 outbreak and social distancing reccomendations i was wondering if i can put my membership on hold or refund
__label__Positive	during covid - 19 crisis organizations channelling caught scaling back headed virtual ' wemembership ' relationships because well as keeping two attendants in hot desking spaces under vancouver . after crisis passes we will be seeking bodily space and ideally staying with wework .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 not using space enough
__label__Negative	you should explore being unable to allow person to retain their desk space in return for break service retainer ( just stopping monthly payments ) or keeping small monthly fee running to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i . e . covid19 ) . i think that would show some loyalty to your members which they would return to you whereas only alternative i lack is to terminate my membership .
__label__Negative	i ' m member across various contracts and have been big fan of wework . you are completely neglecting biggest concern and that mood members have and it ’ s not doing you any favours all at . wework members actually all are on private slack channel talking planning and mass direct debit cancellation and termination . they are also talking to journalists too . this is of because fact you aren ’ t communicating on rent issue while they are struggling . walking around some of wework buildings i can see people have already started moving out mass en too . what ’ s it to for wework to show it ’ s some members courtesy ? if you don ’ t want complete revolt from members i ’ d strongly suggest better response is sent out today to show really you do care about struggles they all are facing now .
__label__Negative	wework concept is amazing i think were some physical and management issues with no.1 spinningfields being new building and wework has been through some changes corporately since i invested two years ago which has affected service negatively . overall i 'm satisfied but with reduced level of service it 's become too expensive alongside market changes ( brexit / general election / coronavirus ) which have negatively impacted my business . i 've also encountered two members at wework that lack integrity and i do n't wish to be associated with them . my business is 12 years old and i work with public sector agencies and reception staff did n't treat me / my clients with respect i feel we deserve ( they were n't as professional with wework members / visitors as their corporate occupiers in my view ) .
__label__Neutral	will back for larger office ( 15 + in wework if impossible ) once covid is done .
__label__Negative	this is nonsense ! so why you send your whole team into homes but you keep doors open for others and when you they will not always be . this smells like bs to keep your companies from paying rent . you will have no companies anywhere left at this rate guys ! you give companies rent free period if everyone is at home .
__label__Neutral	( thread with member is very long see next box for request ) member doesn ' want to break their 2 year commitment but they are ready to forfeit their sr as `` sunk cost . '' i do n't see any tools that we have to pause their membership unless we want to offer them 2 months free to try and keep their business .
__label__Negative	i would have enjoyed my experience at we -work until well quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . for me option to be able to hot desk in all other locations it was one of the main perks , and something i will miss . for for me , crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to risk expose its members and front - line employees to risk were deal breakers .
__label__Positive	hannah and anna at 655 montgomery are always extremely accommodating . it feels like they are an extension of our team because they really are ! looking forward to heading back in office post covid 19 quarantine .

__label__Negative	wework should not be open . people keep testing positive for coronavirus . it 's irresponsible to keep it open .
__label__Negative	imputable to covid and nyc issues we will non be able to move items on 4 / thirty and i have asked repeatedly for guidance as to how we are expected to move out when city will be on shutdown . please advise and predict me at 215 - 280 - 0844 thank you
__label__Negative	if we are under order by our state government to have shelter-in-place will you be waiving our april rent payment and crediting half of march ? due to financial constraints without that we may need to terminate our relationship with wework altogether .
__label__Neutral	since i am not “ essential to ” and ordered to temporarily stay in my place at home in ca will i we thinkwork can be wai 'ving from my membership fees during “ my shelter in place ” order in ca ca ?
__label__Negative	nothing . has tough on business
__label__Negative	please all doors you have to open 1000 times per day open when you use your card on reader . it ' s been pretty annoying an also health issue since you but in of virus scare it ' s worse have hundreds of people having to touch and drag door handles all they need to go . has been terrible design since day .
__label__Negative	it ’ s actually ironic that you talk about “ covid support ” while wework wants to charge us for not returning keys since our contract with you is expiring today.we ’ ve been asked to and i am quoting “ go to postal offices ” otherwise we will be charged hundred pounds per key.this is really shameful just hope you are aware of that .
__label__Positive	" you stay safe team – you ’ re doing great today .
__label__Negative	taking time out and working from home whilst covid-19 blows over . will return once industry starts to pick back up .
__label__Negative	i think way you 're handling your tenants during corona virus pandemic is poor . 50 % rent reduction when govt . has issued stay at home order ? i was big fan of weworks but not now . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful now that i would refer anyone to weworks . we 'll pay your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stayed with you forever . not feeling like i want to stay in place that charges tenants that have been ordered by govt to stay home ! terrible upper management decision making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for you .
__label__Neutral	significant financial issues due to ua covid - 19
__label__Negative	under all circumstances love it . handling of covid response service . i have no access in writing whatever i come to during any situation . besides i ’ m still paying full price on our contract

__label__Negative	very disappointed with how wework has been handling covid situation .
__label__Neutral	we were concerned adequately to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own fixtures entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home dropped building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested hiv positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20 . separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success . we realize this is difficult data for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you creditor back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we sera retake normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021 . kidnapping forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides
__label__Positive	simply to covid now i forward to getting touch all over to arrange something else . love you all .
__label__Neutral	 thanks for getting around to it . i we are signed on through Canada but our company has been hit very hard by current circumstances . i was hoping could be some flexibility in our membership terms . it will be harder for us to continue with are current agreement .

__label__Positive	member women who had signed her move out for end of march due to cashflow struggles got part time job via another labs member funds of dollars she had allocated to cancel out her move - signing and re - activating her labs membership . yiran said that she expects labs community participation more than ever to spend four tough months to strategize as her app is in hospitality sector .
__label__Negative	under normal circumstances i like facilities . but operations under risk of potential corona virus is underwhelming .
__label__Negative	only reason i gave lower marks for office is that i wish frosting on windows went up higher - too much visibility into our office which can compromise confidentiality . some companies on our floor use shared space for what are obviously lengthy internal meetings.i strongly feel that ending coffee and beer service and honesty market is an overreaction to virus situation . cleanliness and common sense should prevail . now we have to go out to to convenience stores and coffee shops - wastes time and we interact with lot more people .

__label__Negative	i offered to downgrade to hot desk and was refused because i was in quarantine and notified after march 1st would not accommodate critical infrastructure business after being exposed to covid by wework employee . now i am leaving all together .
__label__Negative	it would 've been alot more helpful if wework made accommodations to honor my request to cancel membership end of march due to covid-19 pandemic instead of sticking with membership agreement of 30 day notice to move out . in other circumstances i would have honored lease agreement .

__label__Negative	1 - bring straight single glass forks and spoons at least for this hard time we are in with virus . 2 - we dont use same towels for cleaning kitchen counters tables and other surface areas . 3 - also lot of times is hard finding mug jars and cups if you go to kitchen in afternoon thats due towards other people which keep them in their desk drawers . not sure how this issue can be resolved but i would say start posting posters around kitchen areas . other tables page 3 i love ;

__label__Neutral	we are member of london marks square community and as i ’ m sure you are aware uk government regulations are stating that people remain at home and are only permitted out for essential activities . strict regulations currently in place in uk mean that we are not in position to use facilities/services at marks square . we are an ngo with added complication that it takes us about year to claim vat back on wework fee and next 6 months will be putting an economic strain on our operations.i have been trying to find out for some time now what support you/wework will be giving us in respect of our membership fees . similar organisations to yourself are providing rent relief to support their members through these very difficult times.please can someone back to me as matter of urgency .

__label__Neutral	asking for abatement at 14 tai po wan road if building closes - this firm considered an essential business ( financial need ) and they rely heavily on being physically in office . please back to us asap . angie thank you for sending this . i think you may have perhaps misunderstood my specific query here . i am fully aware of government guidelines in each market and way in which we work is implementing these . my specific enquiry is around what wework is intending to do to compensate ten for fact that we were paying for office space and services in wework offices which we can not now access . as result we are now incurring significant maintenance costs to ensure our team have suitable place to work . our expectation holds that we will not be charged any fees for time that we are not able to access our wework offices . i need to urgently whether wework intend to ref [MASK] our service fees for duration that offices are closed . i would imagine wework will have global policy on this . if not please advise what situation would be if our offices in hong kong were to close tomorrow . thank you .

__label__Negative	reduced one person office to hot desk and working from home due to national and state of nevada laws restricting use due to covid19 . i feel wework should have immediately allowed this reduction and not forced me to pay thru may because i see it as an effort to support wework w/o just leaving- i thought your goal was to help start ups and small businesses . i am disadvantaged wosb who believes in and supports wework summerlin las vegas while putting next to no extra burden on their overhead . )
__label__Negative	 in normal circumstances the rating might be reduced but i think you ' ve chosen seriously odd time to ask for feedback given we ca n 't work in your offices during breaks and they want to increase our chances of getting coron av irus .

__label__Negative	main ii reasons driving my expiration are 1 . inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . deuce . value vs quality offering is non compelling at martin place location . fundamentally i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single soul office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .

__label__Neutral	wework like probably majority of your community members i am running small start-up business from office space i rent from wework . coronavirus has hit our cashflow hard and we are now in fight for survival of business . in meantime we are still paying rent for expensive office space that is empty as all my staff are working from home . one of my team had to go into our building briefly yesterday and said it was almost entirely empty so most occupiers are in similar position . please can you confirm what wework is to do to support your community of small business / start-up tenants through this unprecedented time ? not only are we as tenants all paying for service we ca n't use without support is very real risk could be no wework community very soon as businesses either go bust or chose to default on their rent . i ca n't imagine it would be in wework 's commercial interests to allow that to happen . i look forward to your response . ( i have already raised this matter with community team who did n't what to say )

__label__Negative	when will leadership information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices ( which we ca n ' t do again due to lockdown ) . ' ve just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n ' t actually been and we can not move to use due to lockdown ) . this service fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has had our revenue destroyed by virus as well . we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also cc ' d ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership . it should not be only landlords that paid in and everyone else gets . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy ' s occupancy rate and financial health . i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .

__label__Neutral	firstly we hope you and all your colleagues are well and safe during this time.at aaron basha it is our upmost priority to protect safety and well-being for all our employees . due to recent news and uncertainty surrounding covid-19 we had made decision to heed warning of federal and local authorities and require our employees to conduct business at home until it is safe for everyone . we are also doing this since our employees rely on ny and nj mass transit to to work.we would like to what concessions wework is currently giving tenants if any . for this reason we are requesting concession and relief in our monthly rent . although wework is giving its members options where to work since is limited staffing we do not feel shared environment is safe .
__label__Neutral	i just wanted to reach out to you in regards to everything on right now surrounding corona virus outbreak . i we just started our contract but with way market is and everyone working from home office costs are really weighing on us . we are considering our next moves but before we do anything i wanted to see if is anything you can do about our fees .
__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to office issues were for lack of better service something a 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is nonexi exclusive - zero privacy in business matters especially in conference numbers . even during covid - - no offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as shortly as this crisis is over i will be cancelling my contract and finding new companies .
__label__Positive	i leave definitely render once covid thing gets o'er .

__label__Positive	you for hosting supporting since 2015 . we forward reengaging once covid has and normal business resumes .
__label__Negative	when will leadership provide information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices today ( which we ca n't do again due to lockdown ) .i 've just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n't actually been setup and we can not move to or use due to lockdown ) .this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has had our revenue destroyed by virus as well.we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also cc 'd ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership.it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else gets screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework 's occupancy rate and financial health.i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .
__label__Negative	negatives : 1 . not enough meetings rooms after phone booths were removed but plenty of empty offices that are locked and available for not use2 . bathrooms do not toilet have seat covers ( unsanitary very especially now with covid - 19 pandemic starting to spread to this very county we ' re in located ) . positives : 1 . community team is exceptional kiersten . austefjord matsudaira adriene and lindsey palmer are solely responsible for majority of positives for this score . without them score your would ' ve been at best . 4 they are responsive helpful and have very positive attitudes . 2 . amenities and common areas are very well done comfortable and while still providing professional setting for work to be done . 3 . location is very good .

__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this stuff is coming from you but the leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that what they need to stay open because ' s essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only by cards . this is wework not not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they ' re taking hit . ' s government order to stay inside spaces so we ca n ' t use space even though if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening up to suspending our lease , then we need to seriously cancel it as of april 1st

__label__Negative	the overall electrical service is subpar . it ' s clear that wework team always prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business partners to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have failed to ask for soap in men ' s room . not even sure why when corona virus and flu season are at a high . the water bottle / fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or even fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never even has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands . the general sentiment from office to our office manager that is when are we moving ?
__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and good spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours.based on nature of our business ( face-to-face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay off employees and close our offices in nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer need these office spaces.i 'm sure given nature of weworks work this is also not an ideal time for you all and i 'm sure you have bunch of different things on as far as managing this nightmare.so for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due to `` shelter-in-place '' order they 've closed office to all `` non-essential businesses '' in philly due to confirmed covid-19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening date.after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to reopen spaces we have with wework . however we need to cancel our memberships in those spaces asap.is way to immediately cancel membership to those spaces for april billing cycle or what exceptions are you making for times in which shared coworking spaces are regulated out of our control by government ?

__label__Neutral	i am in live event business . we are ticket brokerage and sell tickets to live events nationwide ( concerts theatre sports etc -- pretty much everything that has been canceled ) . like many others covid is to have drastic impact on my business . we do not expect anyone to be buying tickets int he near future . which pretty much eliminates all incoming revenues . i am also following instructions of cdc and our government and not working remotely . is anything that can be done that can assist me in terms of assisting with rent pro-rating and/or holding off on payment until things clear up ? i do not expect to be at wework location for immediate future . please let me if anything can be done .
__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member company offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid - 19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred again without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is easier to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much longer ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with an exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 5th and march 18th . i therefore avoid value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that this is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments about other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no - reply @ wework . com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche . io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively affected by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p . s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid - 19 by this visitor .

__label__Negative	i am not happy with how wework cope with covid19 . members are forced to pay for membership potentially leading to people wanting to back to wework against all medical advises . i am disappointed by ww 's inflexibility to adapt to pandemic crisis which is reason why i wo n't return to wework even after crisis is gone .

__label__Negative	complete with lack of leadership flexibility in response time to co -vid - 19 and refusal to acknowledge any interruption time to business process for developing our company . we certainly would never use we shouldwork again nor recommend it to other startups .
__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in - house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april . besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in - office capacity by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but get even obligated to have most of them work sufficiently remote . as situation is progressing our believe evacuation would be more difficult to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in case of future developments it is unpredictable when situation will warrant for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps possible later .
__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some members of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non - essential and definitely so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had the 3 cases of covid - 19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is a struggling financially doesn ’ t give you you right to put people ’ s health and well - being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing the right thing i will have to decide how i would want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as it i do . just because you email information to your members , it doesn ’ t it true . i never would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .
__label__Negative	no relief on any request made due to hardship or during due to virus . also putting greed above people 's safety by keeping buildings open . i blame this entirely on finance not excellent staff .
__label__Negative	 i think way you ' re handling your tenants during cor ona virus pand emic is poor . 50 % rent cut when go vt . then issued stay at home order ? i was big supporter of you but changed now . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful i that i would refer anyone to we works . we ' ll pay your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stayed with you forever . not feeling like i want my stay at place that has tenants that have been ordered by go vt to stay home ! terrible upper financial decision making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for you .

__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is antithesis of creating global community . this feels like self - serving denarii grabbing move at expense of your members and and creating truly safe installations . as small business strain this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4 + year working link . as emerson said “ your actions are so loud i can ’ t hear your words . . . ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of brans members [ and global community ] shows your true colors and your dearth of clinics . this is charged email mostly because every piece of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed and continues to manage this . be leaders in space that needs leadership n't an opportunistic self serving organization . p . s . do right thing and close without charging your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .
__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) . but i was little disappointed to see today - i sure felt ok coming in here during pandemic . b / c not lot of people today are in here and wework had sent me out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at the common area i sat at earlier yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are still not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are constantly getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .

__label__Negative	we have been at our location with varying numbers of offices since our site opened . it is great concept . however of late we have been increasingly dissatisfied and concerned . we were out of toner to print for over month . repeatedly told desk . . . oh we . . . . would be response . then market went dark for months . we are in an area where is no where to grab soda . now everyones offices have stashes of food and drink . market did show back up recently . now with corona virus and everyone being so cautious . . . . one side women restroom was out of soap this week . today other women ' s restroom only has paper towels sitting on table where everyone has to pick up entire roll thus touching center and passing germs on that . unacceptable . holder is partly empty of towels . so playing devils advocate that supplier is out of paper towels for that holder pay 10 for holder so we do n ' t have to cross contaminate ourselves trying to wash our hands ! ! ! ! !

__label__Neutral	we would like to spend zero in april and onward while offices are closed or we are not working at office . after we return to work/offices are open for normal operations we are prepared to pay rent you we have now . we are prepared to commit to 3 or 6 months .
__label__Positive	foxies hope you ’ re all well ! i just wanted you to check out something we ’ ve got bookings tomorrow at the wework , mark square and three york road — will we still not be able today to access the building in light rays of bullet zero point 4 ?
__label__Negative	lack of flexibility while office is closed during covid-19 and high pressure with 2 hour deadline to recommit to contract
__label__Neutral	thank you for this federal reserve note – think it makes lot of sense . one ask … in order to to ‘ my ’ we work ( chancery lane ) i ’ m required to exchange elevating risk of coming into contact with someone with virus . i have wework 100m from my compressed – north west house . is any way that whilst risk is still elevated ace could temporarily work from desk next door ? based on below guidelines would be handiness and it should increase safety for all … including my pregnant wife and ii year old . this would be really comprehended

__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming charge ” and am truly disgusted nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job. ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors may continue to go to their jobs.weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential business . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has been shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive orders we can through this and be back to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making choices in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well being during this horrific pandemic .
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and willingly increase infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Negative	really poor service during covid 19 situation
__label__Negative	i understand these are unprecedented times and is major impact on wework like companies renting space . that said approach here has shown zero leniencies . your costs are down as it relates to us not being able to send people to office and yet our costs have not been addressed . i ’ ll let samiksha continue to manage communication on our behalf . but as you raise this up to upper management please with approach here showing no compromise combined with lack of focus to right-size our space over last 6 months we 've lost confidence in wework . this leads me to tell you as of now without changes on behalf of our board we will 100 % not be renewing at end of our term . i hope this position changes as your stance does but please accept this as notice if not .
__label__Neutral	thanks for getting in hint . still await for decision on rental payments . would make up great if you could address that .
__label__Positive	good sharing of items here that organizations do n ' t have to worry about . great front desk technical professionals who are very atten -tive . great supporting staff that would still have gone back to work during the covid - 19 to sure our office place is clean and " ge -rm - free . " thanks for that .

__label__Positive	great experience great support in cologne despair to return after covid19 times
__label__Negative	office is never clean bathrooms are often out of toilet paper or hand towels rent is extremely expensive cold brew is during limited hours and often runs out beer on tap was removed no more snacks available for purchase wework did not any statement on coronavirus until after everyone was required to work from home on state level phone booths were removed due to potential cancer causing materials - no replacements were made and no updates were provided to tenants
__label__Positive	gener8 5-person startup has decided to keep one fully paid desk at labs despite needing to cancel their other 4 while they ca n't access office due to covid-19 . in words of founder sam `` we ’ ll keep this so that we can still stay close to you and be part of labs community .
__label__Negative	cleanliness of bathrooms on 11th floor is absolutely shocking . is corona epidemic and 99 % of time is no soap and at 9am place looks like warzone .
__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .
__label__Positive	hannah and anna at 655 montgomery are perpetually extremely accommodating . information technology feels like they personify an extension of our team because they really make up ! looking forward to heading rearwards in office emily price post covid 19 quarantine .
