__label__Negative	i 've worked in weworks before ( times square and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches have food/crumbs/stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events /popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else 's lunch crumbs or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .

__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .

__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because 's essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they 're taking hit . 's government order to stay inside so we ca n't use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st
__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to covid-19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i 'm korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between those hours.also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work.the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels.the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and ammedities are good.lastly employees at wework do n't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .

__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that powers at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non - essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid - 19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well - being at risk . efforts have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior remains making me question kind of company you are used whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want involves handle mentioning this outputs . it seems to me that if ny refugees knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n't let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we 're not supposed to go in to office so we ca n't even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us was trying to lock us into one year commitment .

__label__Negative	1. i think that service quality has gone down bit since reorganization of corporate . we always experienced lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated.2 . has been no effort to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this covid crisis.3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4. part of wework 's value prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited to 9am to 6pm this does n't reflect way business is done in nyc . 5. our front desk does n't open until 9am . in normal nyc building desks are staffed 24/7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .

__label__Negative	 i ' ve been in we works before ( times square and b ry ant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches get food / cr umbs / st ools etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use a hook on back of doors otherwise just have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events / pop ups but miss honesty market ! also love addition for k omb a to tap on 14 — hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had san it izing wipes in there because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else ' s lunch cr umbs or p uddle from a cup sweating on table . plus coron av irus . lol .

__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020 * * hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated . the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment farm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet ours financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to become compounded if rent stays at current level . the additional space is very much to bear surplus to requirements so i encouraged to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and assists relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is anymore shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able approached use space for foreseeable future . i that we have contract until jul so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number registered priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated . i look forward to hearing back from you . bestleon devereux

__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at our work has just pulled nasty havoc for our occupants . claim that they need to stay open because ' s essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they ' re taking hit . ' s government order to stay inside so we ca n ' t use space nor if we wanted space so for wework not to provide relief too absurd . if you guys arent opening or suspending your lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st

__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with a global pass . basically they do still not allow due to covid - 19 . but despite working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute now it to local employees . so i ' m korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea we workwork after week of debate allowed for me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just right between those hours . also music on hot desk areas that is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work . the wooden floor does create lot of noise noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels . the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is not good . also drinks and ammedities are good . lastly employees at wework do n ' t do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .
__label__Negative	and i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i still think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) . but i was little disappointed to see today - no i felt ok for coming here during a pandemic b / c not lot of infected people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday cr &umbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york bank st on 7th floor . so far it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are presently getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .

__label__Negative	thanks for sending out this message . whilst this is all very nice it does n't respond to any of challenges your longer-term tenants like my company are facing . will wework pass on reduction of business rates here in uk to your tenants ? are you able to offer tenants short term ( i.e . 3-month ) rent freeze with rents them adjusted up for following period ? i love my wework office and community team is great but so far i would give wework hq big fat zero in terms of engaging and responding to your paying clients . i look forward to hearing from you soon .
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space . efficacy immediately wework is not allowed withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to . here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out . if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling ours lease and what that means requests respect to our deposit during timescale of crisis that moves most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and mes will most likely need to bring our general counsel in helps deal requests this . we have not been in office since second week of march as i encountered felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer . please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24 - 48 hours .

__label__Neutral	 thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time and send it through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishops gate regarding our membership to be paused and i believe it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to we work directors for our contract to remain suspended until end of may . our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current cor ona virus crisis we ' ve lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects . we can not claim any business rates relief because as we work tenants we don � � t pay any . we may be able to apply for go vt grant announced recently but even if successful we don � � t when those funds would reach us . i believe we have been good tenants and we work paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but cor ona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and hum bly request that you pause our contract until end of may . if we can n 't operate then we won � � t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round . we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we ' re able get back to some norm ality once lockdown is over however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please asking we work directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to remain afloat ?

__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .
__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is antithesis of creating global community . this feels like self-serving money grabbing move at expense of your members and creating truly safe space . as small business pressure this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4+ year working relationship . as emerson said “ your actions are so loud i can ’ t hear your words ... ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of its members [ and global community ] shows your true colors and your lack of care . this is charged email mostly because every piece of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed and continues to manage this . be leaders in space that needs leadership not an opportunistic self serving organization . p.s . do right thing and close without charging your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .

__label__Negative	staying wework open during this of time crisis is antithesis of global creating community . this feels like self - money serving grabbing move at expense of your members creating and truly safe space . as small pressure business this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4 + year working relationship . as emerson said “ your actions are so loud i can ’ t hear your words . . . ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of its members [ global and community ] shows your true colors and your lack of care . this is charged email mostly because piece every of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed continues and to manage this . be leaders in space needs that leadership not an opportunistic self serving organization . p . s . do right thing and close without charging your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .

__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in - house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure off 1st april . besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in - office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote . as situation is recede we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces off 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .

__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides

__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .

__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space.effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to.here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out.if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this.we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer.please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24-48 hours .

__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march when fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20 . separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay out whole and in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success . we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would better find constructive solution than move forward abruptly . i would like will submit following for you and 750 management employees to consider you taking back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume january payments in june and extend term through feb 2021 . look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides

__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end of may.our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we 've lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects.we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us.i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and humbly request that you pause our contract until end of may.if we ca n't operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round.we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we 're able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?

__label__Neutral	original request - post - shelter in place - as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4 . 098 – 4 . 102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4 . 1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . furthermore i ’ m sure you ’ d appreciate with 16 - 19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise this this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for one 7 person office ( 4 . 1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease . could we have conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request - post - shelter in place - i ’ m aware a recent announcement in new york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non - essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space before we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non - usage .

__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear back from building management . and yes it ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non-essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move-out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to me they could be considered an “ essential ” business…on related note were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to be further work done in coming days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current circumstance.lastly please keep me posted once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously stated i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality…many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and effort.sending my best grant

__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020**hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated.the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays at current level.the additional space is very much to be surplus to requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able to use space for foreseeable future.i that we have contract until july so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated.i look forward to hearing back from you.bestleon devereux

__label__Negative	nothing . covid has been tough on business
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework ' s recent statement of policy . california is under state - wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid - 19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent abstracts from corporate . . . and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter / hotspots of transmission . unless you truly are doing this for ` ` essential businesses ' ' than stipulation that only businesses that are ` ` essential ' ' - indicators . e . ` ` healthcare insurance le supplies as you state ' ' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as distressing effort to put advantage over public safety . when dust rules history will warranted harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .
__label__Negative	none of that . i that wework owns meetup inc. wework claims to have health and safety of its workers and clients as top priority . meetup group in boulder colorado called hikers anonymous is breaking all rules for stopping spread of covid -19. tomorrow they are taking an outing of 12 people snowshoeing not 10 or less in state guidelines . they are also carpooling ignoring social distancing by crowding multiple people into cars for 90 minute drives each way . it 's irresponsible and dangerous to whole country by contributing directly to spread of virus . it also often leads directly to infection and deaths of people in vulnerable groups . i realize this is n't your area but please route this message to proper people in charge including meetup inc .
__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) .but i was little disappointed to see today - i felt ok coming here during pandemic b/c not lot of people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .
__label__Positive	 work flow stays great and staff is very positive ~ & professional . k v  is doing fantastic , especially given current cor net virus situation .
__label__Negative	in light of current health crisis i have decided not to renew my office lease and have removed all items from my space . march payment has already been processed and will be last month with wework until covid-19 virus has been blunted . please let me what further actions are needed as i do not wish to move forward with three month additional term . fortunately no contract was ever signed on my end .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1. inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2. value vs quality offering is not compelling at martin place location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single person office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .
__label__Neutral	we need to continue our business in virtual way due to covid-19 . once that passes we will then seek an office at that point in time .

__label__Negative	you also should be closing your tax offices because of covid - act 19 and refund someing companies their rent for time that they can not be fully utilizing facility . big coworking spaces are not safe place not to also be thus you also are disregarding health and safety risks of tenants , and your employees .

__label__Negative	after reaching out months ago about clean -liness issues ( and repeatedly before that ) and also trying to go to month at our current rent rate we were met again with much resistance and sort of ` ` too bad ' ' response . even despite poor service we decided to go month to month while agreeing to an increase in our rent . then on march 16 we submitted request to leave based out on covid above mentioned concerns concerns about shared workspace continued issues with cleanliness etc . we were only offered relief if we engaged in signing contract to long term agreement . such bad policy especially in time like this . feels very much like opportunizing in a time of crisis . seems very ironic for company that is supposed to foster strong sense of community care to be so unsupportive in current state . eveytime in past several weeks that we wework email i think this must be rent adjustment policy or pause in membership etc . but it has never come . we have very bad taste from this ` ` wizard of oz ' ' answers always where people working at tower49 said they did n ' t have authority and would send an email or request to those higher ups . we are exiting immediately . upon stay at home mandate being over we all will collect our items . if anyone would like to reach out to me please feel free to call for me at 917 - 972 - 287 -2 .

__label__Neutral	liked culture people customer success team i have interacted with observing their politeness and support specially akshay amanda nishita & hiral . i found wework is incorrect place for startup to motivated being in competitive environment and having an opportunity for collaborating with people from community . wework have many centers for business focusing off location specific for flexibility . an effort that is being addressed to build community surely will evolve in coming time . most importantly need more people to arrange washroom hygiene suggesting office space dirty staff & workers should have more safety in terms of masks food hours proper shoes masks and gloves ( where ever required ) . right measures for prevention of stopping spread of coronavirus as it becomes threat of idle in large community together . kind of health protection and care wall designs at washroom and pantry display outlets .
__label__Negative	i have enjoyed good experience assuming we work until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus erupted . for me option to be able to hot desk in other locations was none of those focuses on something i will admit . for me crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to expose its members and front - line employees to risk were deal breaker .

__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non-essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid-19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well-being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter.as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions/ potential recessions in market.i need to some facts/ figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place.we currently have lease that ends in approximately july/ august and monthly rental $ 12,257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space.while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this '' [ cm team responded with policy ]

__label__Negative	efforts ' m member across various contracts and have been big likes of wework . you are completely neglecting biggest concern and mood that members have and it ’ s not doing you any favours at all . wework members are actually all on private slack channel intervening levels planning mass direct debit cancellation and termination . they are also talking to journalists so . this is because of fact you aren ’ t communicating on rent issue while they welcome struggling . walking around some of wework buildings i can see men have already started electing out en mass too . what ’ s it to for wework to show it ’ s members some courtesy ? if you don ’ t want complete revolt from members i ’ d strongly suggest better response is spearheaded out today to show you really do care about struggles they are all facing now .

__label__Neutral	original request- pre-shelter in place- as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4.098 and 4.102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4.1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ m sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv-19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise that this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4.1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease.could we have conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request- post- shelter in place- i ’ m aware of recent announcement in new york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non-essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non-usage .

__label__Neutral	discount on membership and lease due to corona virus ?
__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end in march instead of april given covid - 19 situation , hough used language as our decision to work from home is an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd . it ' s this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid - 19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual arrangements to keep our independence just say that but ' n ' t say we ' re being cautious given the crisis .

__label__Negative	members have been failed by wework during covid . every day their list is news , story about your board fighting with soft loansbank and question of wework whose cash flow is constantly in question . but your response has always been to pretend nothing is happening and to not reassure members . it ’ s really disappointing , as your brand has always been about members but when it came down to it wework has not provided .

__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .

__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .

__label__Negative	 i � � m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in this email . i have been trying to response from we work relating to rent since march 17 th day after prime minister john son asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i � � ve received is that we work is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 days since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inund ated with members like me who need answers fast . it is unreasonable and insensitive for we work to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by you . has also been number of we work members testing positive to coron av irus which suggests that co - working environments are very unsafe place we be at this time . add itionally we work are not clear on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . we work pr ides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of we work members don � � t care yoga or meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact . i have been huge supporter of we work since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we � � ve had with we work have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks . a few years ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cash flow is at complete stand still i t ve had to let staff go and we � � re dealing with company charging us rent unre i have blocked payment of our membership fees for apr il and will not be returning to office if we work are not able to resolve the problem as matter of urgency . you owe your members better than this .
