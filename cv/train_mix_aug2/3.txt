__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end shopping at end of march instead of april given covid - 19 situation ayr - hough used language that our decision to work from home is an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' . government advice tends to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using we alone is absurd and it ' s some sort of langauge ! and explains why co tempest - 19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to avoid contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n ' t say we ' m being cautious given current crisis .

__label__Negative	although wework is great place and structure to work fact that nyc locations have not shut down ( especially locations where covid had outbreaks ) is both irresponsible and inconsiderate to both employees as well as those who have to return to an unsafe environment .
__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is the antithesis part of creating global community . this feels like self - serving money grabbing move nothing at expense of your members and creating truly safe space . as small business pressure this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members .

__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid-19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no-reply @ wework.com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche.io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Positive	max ! , i ' m looking for an office and space in the sf ( the room above or on floor ) for 3 people for us around $ 1000 give - or . how would even that be feasible ? and thanks !
__label__Negative	none of that . i that wework owns meetup inc. wework claims to have health and safety of its workers and clients as top priority . meetup group in boulder colorado called hikers anonymous is breaking all rules for stopping spread of covid -19. tomorrow they are taking an outing of 12 people snowshoeing not 10 or less in state guidelines . they are also carpooling ignoring social distancing by crowding multiple people into cars for 90 minute drives each way . it 's irresponsible and dangerous to whole country by contributing directly to spread of virus . it also often leads directly to infection and deaths of people in vulnerable groups . i realize this is n't your area but please route this message to proper people in charge including meetup inc .
__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally obviate to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and unwillingly decrease infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Neutral	work from home until mess with covid says that travel is safe again
__label__Negative	after reaching out months ago about cleanliness issues ( and repeatedly before that ) and trying to go to month at our current rent rate we were met with much resistance and sort of ` ` too bad ' ' response . even despite poor service we decided to go month to while month agreeing to an increase in our rent . then on march 16 we submitted request to leave based on covid above mentioned concerns concerns about shared workspace continued issues with etc cleanliness . we were only offered relief if we engaged in signing contract to long term agreement . such bad policy especially in time like this . very feels like much opportunizing in time of crisis . seems ironic for company is that supposed to foster strong sense of community care to be so unsupportive in state current . eveytime in past several weeks that we wework email i think this must be rent adjustment policy or pause in membership etc but . it has never come . we have very bad taste from this ` ` wizard of oz ' ' answers always where people working at tower49 said they did n ' t have authority and would send an email request to those higher ups . we are exiting immediately . upon stay at home mandate being over we will collect our items . if anyone would like to reach out to me please feel free to call me at 917 - 972 2872 - .
__label__Positive	 thanks . constant emails continue updates on building status in connection to coron av irus . sometimes free updates from everyone and sample new stuff are offered along with activities coordinated by our staff ! community staff are extremely helpful and friendly .
__label__Positive	wework strive successfully to keep order , tries to create space . in these challenging times ( covid times ) are still constant communication flow and are still scheduled for online interaction . give me this rocks ! ! !
__label__Positive	prior to covid19 epidemic we malfunction seems to be ideal with working space and facilities to match with nonmodern environment . with fear of disease spreading now i disbelieve wework would implement up to date incautious practices such as unsocial distancing in elevator and everywhere frequent cleaning and hygiene etc . i begrudge all best .
__label__Negative	due to outbreak of covid-19 and unprecedented events that have ensued we felt that reducing our costs would be better for long term financial health of our company
__label__Negative	we just this email . stride management non essential business and as you aware state of california issued stay at home order on march 19th due to ongoing situation with coronavirus . we have been directed by governor not operate our business at wework and wework in turn has been directed not allow to do so . accordingly please suspend automatic ach rent payments from stride to wework immediately until this crisis has stay at home order has been lifted by state . please confirm receipt .

__label__Negative	i will impersonally sure that everyone i and work with has thin understanding of way wework has refused to negotiate or malfunction with us during covid19 crisis and incomplete devastation of our customer base .
__label__Positive	devon and ellie were great as well as more staff . i liked this right before panic hit .
__label__Negative	its great on site service . lovely staff . good experience with amenities . gps - info delayed systems . no explanation yet regarding office closures .
__label__Positive	devon evans and adrienne were great friends as , well , as other staff . really liked leaving this location before covid had hit .
__label__Negative	prior to covid - 19 be an issue with others from bigger offices take calls in hall that was very riotous .
__label__Neutral	client reasoned that their employees do not feel comfortable in or are mandated not to by government and they are not using space for next few months . they are looking for some sort of flexibility and understanding so that they can continue to grow with wework in future as management team and all employees really love wework .
__label__Negative	wework office is great - but it 's of no use to me because i ca n't access any of it during this covid crisis but you are not communicating what membership options are . you will lose so many people whereas reduction or negotiation in fees might see me holding onto my place and waiting this out ... has been so little proactive communication from you . this is not way to deal with this crisis .
__label__Negative	dear sir / madam i am an employee that works at wework 615 s college st . charlotte nc 2820 -2 . on saturday i received an email from lonjezo maliro - miller that upon getting the message that one of members that was works in 615 location has corona virus they were to shut down building indefinitely and in meantime clean it . on sunday i received a second placed email stating that area was disinfected and that then it was safe to work . i feel that this is pure negligence because virus might have been spread from one person to another and it ' s not enough time to verify whether anyone else is infected . so its not matter whether area will be safe on monday but upcoming days as well . i hope you can do something about this ! please do not disclose my name with " anyone from foreign building . i will also forward you emails that we have received ! " thank you !
__label__Neutral	due to corona virus situation i ca n't use office as usual . is any discount for monthly fee ?
__label__Positive	great difficulty / difficulty in cologne hope to return the covid19 times
__label__Positive	alex has been discharged and we am very sad to have leaving due to u - 19 .
__label__Neutral	i be under mandatory quarantine and deemed unessential per order of local modern york government . realize below . we be scheduled to motivate out in apr merely will need to cancel membership and expedite relocation out .
__label__Negative	 while have never had issues with parking meter and coffee i ' mma been working from home recently back to ear infection and find that i miss into w w office .
__label__Neutral	! staying home for covid quarantine . will be back when this is all over . thanks !
__label__Positive	i had great experience at town square we work and loved it . due to covid - 19 . i first thought was ' n ' t comfortable using shared workspace and but then we had to shut down our start up due to co -vid - 19 so we can definitely not pay for shared space . i would definitely not use it again and in future under better , economic and health circumstances .
__label__Positive	good keep up work ! virus will pass . we all will be stronger afterward . luis
__label__Negative	could have been more proactive when it eventually came back to the covid19
__label__Positive	great resting place to find work . . . just not during fun times outside of covid .
__label__Negative	nothing just whole haggling of retainer amount was unexpected considering we wanted out due to coronavirus outbreak and ideally should have been able to return in 2 months without having to forfeit whats already been paid and not further pay an additional retainer fee
__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it 's clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men 's room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high.the water bottle/fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands.the general sentiment from office to our office manager is when are we moving ?
__label__Positive	thanks for constant and continue communication on building status in connection to coronavirus . weekly freebies from vendors to sample new stuff are great along with activities coordinated by community staff ! community staff are very helpful and friendly .
__label__Negative	i am concerned about doing 19 require effective spraying that am in age group most susceptible of virus .
__label__Neutral	apijet occupies 6 offices at westlake center in seattle totaling 47 desks . all 47 desks up are for renewal 7 / 31 . employees are requesting to early terminate in their offices except for their 12p . in exchange for this flexibility they offered to sign for another 6 months on 12p ( 7 / 31 - 1 / 31 / 21 ) . apijet provides defense software for airlines carriers . as airlines carrier has been hit very hard by covid - 19 they need drastically less space . continue operating as company . they are long standing partners with wework having been members since 2016 . just three years ago they were looking to expand their presence with us by 30 % and we were planning on touring them on 50 - 60 desk skus this week ( before covid changed our plans ) . when we through covid - 19 they want to grow with them again . given business impact they ' re seeing becuase with covid and long standing partnership we ' ve seen with them over past 5 years they believe this warrants consideration as an exception .
__label__Neutral	19 driven
__label__Neutral	member was terminated from his service . he now has no pay but no eligible for compensation . has already retired and is on release out for 3 / 31 / 2020
__label__Neutral	are sanitizer stations present at tower location in burbank ca ? also are dirty wipe still unavailable for use ? thank you for your help .
__label__Negative	please put signs up at all of your locations telling people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds when leaving bathroom and before eating meals . i often see people leave bathroom without washing their hands.given it 's bad flu season and outbreak of coronavirus washing our hands is one of only defenses we have . please put signs up reminding people to thoroughly wash their hands .
__label__Negative	short-sightedness of wework during covid-19 crisis is frankly embarrassing . has been no effort to support or work with companies leasing from wework . i guess sense of community only goes so far ...
__label__Negative	service offering and all have been cut apart our from rent . communication has poor been too . keep making cutbacks hoping people wo ' n t notice . most gone perks no and mention covid of 19 or impacts to its tenants !
__label__Negative	1 . bath room are made out of paper towels and some faucets remain broken . 2 . kitchen utensils are not clean even after being in dishwash dish . whoever is unloading does n ' t even check . 3 . project covid - 19 shut down trying to package package out of facility became so painful . mailroom clerk did n ' t have access to printer . it did not look like we even staff were available either . project took 3 additional days and 2 scheduled fedex pickup which is an important reason for package to finally leave .
__label__Neutral	subject to amendment to agreement between ww 1460 broadway tenant llc and papaya global inc. dated june 30 2019 we hereby give notice of termination of agreement.according to current situation in which our employees work from their home and do not use their membership we will ask for your consideration to terminate engagement even before termination date pursuant to this notice ( 2 months that end at may 17 2020 ) in order to reduce our costs.please confirm receipt of this termination notice and advise on process ahead .
__label__Negative	el aire acondicionado nunca funcionó para la zona donde estábamos los baños son resbalosos y ocasionó la caida de una persona y varios estuvimos punto de caernos el número de baños son insuficientes para el número de personas que eramos en el espacio y no se apegaron normas de protección ante covid 19 pues es una zona de alto riesgo de contagio .
__label__Negative	terrible treatment of tenants during covid-19 crisis . continuing to charge rent while banning access to buildings is shitty business especially when i read in ft that wework itself is not paying some of its april rent .
__label__Negative	when will leadership provide information about rent or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive today ( which we ca n ' t do again due to lockdown ) . i ' ve just received an invoice today for april for new larger expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n ' t actually been setup and we can not move or use due to lockdown ) . this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for empty room while our business has had revenue destroyed by virus as well . we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also ' d ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership . it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework ' s occupancy rate and financial health . believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .
__label__Negative	what about cleaning etc. will workers be in or working from home ?
__label__Negative	thank you for your email and i reciprocate hopes that you and yours are safe and healthy in this very difficult time . it is indeed very challenging for all of us and will hopefully not last too long . as to wework 's position on collection of our rent which i 'm certain is corporate decision and not an individual position on your part i have to point out again that we are under stay at home order by state of california . it is not legal for us to do business in wework facility at present time nor by extension is it legal for you to allow us to do so as non-essential business . wework 's `` obligation to our members to stay open for those that do rely on our space to operate as business and to those essential businesses who are still coming into our office as they are actively fighting covid '' does not apply to stride management and does not supersede fact that we are prohibited from doing business . clearly concept of prorated relief on rent has already been agreed to by wework as demonstrated by your decision to prorate rent when offices were unavailable due to recent cleaning . now again wework offices are unavailable to us and can not be used by our company . accordingly please suspend all automatic ach rent payments from stride to wework immediately and until this crisis has passed and stay at home order has been lifted by state . i am happy to discuss further with you or any other wework representative . i can be reached at 310-601-6792 .

__label__Negative	dirty bathrooms expensive items of any message or effort in middle of co . - 19 crisis in my building excess of people in a day lack many meeting times - it ' s really bad but always worth money

__label__Negative	 Honestly i love it , i have a fan for years . however , ' m never sure i agree upon how we work has the cov id response for members .
__label__Negative	staff at wework is very friendly and they do organize some cool perks ; however cleanliness of place can use some work . our organization rents big office from wework but floor desks and general area in our office do not cleaned for many days . is dust everywhere ; and given coronavirus situation it would have been great if wework is more cautious of making place clean as well as leave lysol products and hand sanitizers everywhere . thank you . rbc employee
__label__Neutral	 ( ... ) with whole cov id - 19 situation we have begun scaling down our staff , we have 1 engineer except for his office and he has to work from home . is it possible to please rate how we work since we wo not have anyone to go between offices ? we also would like to lower our count to 1 person temporarily until we get back up . thanks
__label__Neutral	my finance department at fever hq has asked me to reach out to you about negotiating terms of our wework lease for april and may as i ' m sure many companies are doing at moment . first does wework plan on extending rent your tenants given covid - 19 situation ? please let me what plan is on your end . fever is asking for each of our markets - new york los angeles and chicago - to postpone payment of our april and may rent payments . as you our business is in live events space unfortunately is having major effect on our company . do you think this would be possible ? keeping in mind that may change and we may be able to to office sooner than june and that we have plans to expand to more markets this year and continue to stay in weworks for future markets as well . let me your thoughts and is .
__label__Negative	 staff at an e gl has worked fantastic . very pleasant and helpful . i have thoroughly enjoyed working for we work . i am forced to leave because of cov ro - 19 . but should be back soon . please do not cancel your membership after 31 st August . thanks .

__label__Neutral	i was wondering if is way for a.c. to be little less cold on 2nd floor here at 379 w. broadway in ny . after recent warm-up weather has turned deceptively colder making it likelier for people to catch cold especially if office is too cold . with current hysteria over wuhan virus any sneeze is likely to create concern in others even if it is sneeze from an innocent cold . that is why i was wondering if a.c. air can be made tad warmer . thanks .
__label__Neutral	i am likely to return to wework in event i can recover financially after coronavirus situation . in meantime i will have to work from my new home location in cherry hill nj .

__label__Positive	i ' ll differ back when covid 19 differ clear
__label__Neutral	looking for our own space currently for post covid
__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment.as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance.the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and it appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter-on-place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020.please confirm . thank you.best katie

__label__Neutral	asking for abatement at 14 taikoo wan road if building closes - this is considered an essential business ( financial services ) and they rely heavily on being physically in office . please back to us asap.angie thank you for sending this.i think you may have perhaps misunderstood my specific query here.i am fully aware of government guidelines in each market and way in which wework is implementing these.my specific enquiry is around what wework is intending to do to compensate ten for fact that we are paying for office space and services in wework offices which we can not now access . as result we are now incurring significant additional costs to ensure our team have suitable place to work.our expectation is that we will not be charged any fees for time that we are not able to access our wework offices.i need to urgently whether wework intend to refund our service fees for duration that offices are closed . i would imagine wework will have global policy on this . if not please advise what situation would be if our office in hong kong were to close tomorrow.thank you .

__label__Positive	will come forward to wework once coronavirus stabilizes
__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .
__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to covid-19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i 'm korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between those hours.also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work.the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels.the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and ammedities are good.lastly employees at wework do n't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .

__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .

__label__Negative	i think way you 're handling your tenants during corona virus pandemic is poor . 50 % rent reduction when govt . has issued stay at home order ? i was big fan of weworks but not now . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful now that i would refer anyone to weworks . we 'll pay your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stayed with you forever . not feeling like i want to stay in place that charges tenants that have been ordered by govt to stay home ! terrible upper management decision making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for you .

__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Neutral	abby thanks during update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as pleased we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment . as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable checking and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance . the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and ones appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported governor deblasio imposes “ shelter - on - place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing assured forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced representation and payment during april 2020 . please confirm . thank you . best katie

__label__Negative	everything about how wework has handled this covid situation has been poorly managed . in weeks leading up to full outbreak / closure was not single hand-sanitizer jar to be found in our offices . bathroom was routinely out of papertowels . one of sinks in women 's restroom has n't worked since we moved in late last year . you 've continued to your staff go in when things were getting worse . i had conversation with one of cleaning folks and they were genuinely afraid for their health but did n't want to lose their job . now we are banned from working and you are trying to upsell us into 12 month lease ? and it 's taking you weeks to figure out how to handle our situation ( and i 'm sure everyone else is in same boat here ) . meanwhile answer should be pretty obvious . other co-working spaces have paused agreements but you 're still trying to squeeze out any last dollar in last ditched effort of self-preservation . while we loved staff at our location and loved product in good times mismanagement during bad times are enough to force us to look elsewhere when this is all stabilized .

__label__Neutral	thank you for update i need to your plans for rent payment holiday . as you we are not able to use facilities at moment . can you give us information about your plans length of payment holiday etc .
__label__Negative	though looking good facilities in fact are not user-friendly slippy floor too bright rooms if they are facing south no control on temperature no drinks/snacks served ( due to covid-19 ) no vending machine . it might be good to stop by and host guests occasionally but it is difficult and inefficient to work in here anticipating proper function .
__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end of may.our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we 've lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects.we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us.i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and humbly request that you pause our contract until end of may.if we ca n't operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round.we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we 're able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?
__label__Negative	it is very regrettable that an option to pause or offer reduced rent differ not break available during covid - 19 crisis . if this was an option i would lack stayed . however is so much uncertainty regarding covid that i had no choice but to cancel my membership until i when covid crisis will begin .
__label__Positive	thanks for inconstant and continue communication on building status in connection to coronavirus . weekly freebies from vendors to sample new stuff are great along with activities coordinated by community staff ! community staff differ very unhelpful and unfriendly .
__label__Neutral	 although our contract gave 30 day notice but am asking that be waived due to cov id 19 years . when its all clear i will still need workspace . if they are fair about refund ing our rent since we did both use space or most of it as such i will consider using your space for our company . thank you .

__label__Neutral	dear azalia first of all we hope you and wework team are safe and healthy right now.as you we represent broadway shows and current shutdown of our industry has put us in very precarious situation ( like so many other industries and companies ) . to be completely upfront - currently affording our full rent will be massive challenge and we respectfully ask for your help during this time . we love wework and it ’ s important to us to be good and responsible members which is why we wanted to reach out as soon as possible with full transparency .
__label__Negative	being calm for covid while not being unable to use office is turn off . i tried to negotiate deal that would help compensate for time lost to no avail
__label__Negative	help for covid-19 affected companies is terrible . wework should be supporting companies instead of putting them in bad situations where they are paying for days in office even during “ safer at home ” ordinance

__label__Negative	 i understand this are unprecedented times and is major impact on we work like companies across space . that said approach here has shown zero len iency . your costs are down as it relates to us not being able to send people to office and yet our concerns are not been addressed . i � � ll let sam i ks ha continue and manage communication on our behalf . but as you raise this up to upper management please with approach here showing no compromise combined with loss of focus to right - size our space over last 6 months we ' ve lost confidence in we work . this leads me to tell you as of now without changes on behalf of our board we will 100 % not be renew ing at end time our term . i understand this position changes as your situation does but please accept this as notice if not .
__label__Neutral	this company correspond parents of students with special needs protected under person with disabilities education act . many of families ( clients of member ) be low income families who are n ' t capable to pay business firm at this time which has lead to limited cash flow . they could utilise reduced rent so firm can stay running and pay employees .
__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming charge ” and am truly disgusted nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job . ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors may continue to go to their jobs . weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential business . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has differ shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive disorder we can through this and be forward to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making choices in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well differ during this horrific pandemic .

__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid - 19 — your employees and members who continue to run inside and out of buildings can and will come in contact with patients at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations via guidelines and direct orders to united states president and staff . . . you are defeating tens of millions of americans and people who are non - quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high - risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with pharmacy cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ' d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work - from - home guidelines since hence you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1. inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2. value vs quality offering is not compelling at martin place location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single person office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .

__label__Positive	we have absolutely had our time before wework and believe that when cr [MASK] of co - takes over we can relax .

__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in-house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april.besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in-office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote.as situation is progressing we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .

__label__Negative	i appreciate your assistant and i sympathise this is coming from you but leadership team at we work have just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because ' s essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . substantive businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they ' re take aim hit . ' s government order to stay put in spite of appearance so we ca n ' t use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of apr 1st

__label__Negative	your company does not value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from us . during covid-19 pandemic you have not conceded any of your membership fees and in fact suggested that we expose our staff to virus by sending them to office because wework was `` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense '' pretense being that majority of their locations remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze us for few nickels now you 've lost potential for any future dollars with us .

__label__Negative	considering that we are in unprecedented times to corona virus issue and visiting wework would not be possible/allowed at least for next 3/4 weeks time due to restrictions it would be great if wework not bill for this & next month .
__label__Neutral	as small nonprofit we 're looking to cut costs where we can and i wanted to see if we 're able to reduce our rent or what it would look like to cancel.some quick notes about org./our team adventure project 501c3our mission is to lift people out of extreme poverty through job creation ( currently our programs are in africa ) after cutting salaries and running our financial projections since covid- 19 we 're looking at 3 - 6 months left of operational runway . this is just for us to survive- we also owe close to $ 200k to our program partners by end of 2020.our founder is 8 months pregnant and has dengue fever ( something that compromises your immune system and stays with you always after getting it ) so we 're obviously not using office currently.notes about our lease agreement ( attached ) rent = $ 3910/monthwe rent 10 person officeour lease is from august 1 2018 for 36 months.most of our biggest donors are unable to support us at this time because they are having their own financial concerns . we 're applying to government grants and are keeping close eye on other options as they roll out but rent continues to be one of our largest expenses .
__label__Negative	week ago we were informed that at sonycenter someone has tested positive with covid i message all community members with some questions and week after no reply at all ! this is an important issue and we could n't count with them . so we decided to cancel our membership because wework is n't as proactive as we thought
__label__Neutral	i am sure we will non only to ask but we wanted to see if wework was offering any concessions or rent abatement for month of apr . as you can imagine our travel clients are suffering ( like all manufacture ) and we ’ re being asked to drastically cut fees for next month ; as pentad - year wework member we wanted to see if discount might be available for next calendar month . i this isn ’ t necessarily your area but want to see if you might be able to discuss on our behalf with sale team . appreciate consideration .

__label__Neutral	i love wework and people that work . it is covid issue and i 'll be back as soon as that is no longer concern . thanks .
__label__Neutral	we would like to spend zero in april and onward while offices are closed or we are not working at office . after we return to work/offices are open for normal operations we are prepared to pay rent you we have now . we are prepared to commit to 3 or 6 months .
__label__Negative	when will leadership provide information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices today ( which we ca n't do again due to lockdown ) .i 've just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n't actually been setup and we can not move to or use due to lockdown ) .this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has had our revenue destroyed by virus as well.we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also cc 'd ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership.it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else gets screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework 's occupancy rate and financial health.i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that highlights of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we calls flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have exactly signed an extension followed addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and and furloughs economies is hard and now we need to address this space . effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to . here is option we would necessitate . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out . if this is not possible we will need to addresses canceling our lease and what that means with observance to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this . we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which rights last way into summer . please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24 - 48 hours .

__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter.as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions/ potential recessions in market.i need to some facts/ figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place.we currently have lease that ends in approximately july/ august and monthly rental $ 12,257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space.while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this '' [ cm team responded with policy ]

__label__Neutral	our wework contract is up this last march 31 2020 . we people were unable to start our move out last week due to office being closed on thursday evening and friday . as a non essential business will we still have enough access to building to complete move off out this week ? has cleaning of building been completed ? given members who have tested hiv positive ?

__label__Neutral	no liked my time there . covid uncertainty makes it imperative for maintaining social distance and with small set up unlike ours we will work remotely and come ahead to wework when things are clearer .
__label__Negative	bullshit . you ' re change open because you ' re on verge of out of business . nobody is to office anymore but you want those rent dollars . i it . you need to survive . but your ` ` openness ' ' especially considering lack been documented covid cases in our office space is irresponsible and will cause birth .

__label__Negative	i 'm deeply disappointed by wework 's refusal to pause contracts in light of covid . as our non-profit faces serious financial crunch wework has thus far been uninterested in sharing hardship .
__label__Negative	so if we ' re not essential and ordered to stay at home are you providing refunds for rent ? i ' m not sure why we should be yield if we are n ' t allowed to come in and front desk staff is n ' t even working any longer nor tail end we packages or chain armour .
__label__Negative	only reason i gave lower marks for office is that i wish frosting on windows went up higher - too much visibility into our office which can compromise confidentiality . some companies on our floor use shared space for what are obviously lengthy internal meetings.i strongly feel that ending coffee and beer service and honesty market is an overreaction to virus situation . cleanliness and common sense should prevail . now we have to go out to to convenience stores and coffee shops - wastes time and we interact with lot more people .
__label__Neutral	just saw that wework will be closed due to virus . i was curious does this mean that our payments for next month will be paused until we have further clarity on situation ? since office space can be significant cost in burn would love to some info on same .
__label__Neutral	while we must unfortunately believe we are in an essential ” classification we may need to access our ( wework ) site in order to continue to provide “ minimum business operations ” ( “ mbo ” ) to our workforce as permitted in executive order . while you do indeed anticipate explicitly needing such access we do have certain it / industry supporting resources on site required to allow us to continue providing mbo . we have been advised that building will be accessible on after hours programming and scheduling should be sufficient to allow contractors to meet mb plans however we would require notification should building access situation change .

__label__Negative	whilst i have been completely satisfied with wework until now i do n't think that wework are handling covid situation particularly well - i have been waiting for weeks to hear whether or not you will be doing anything to support your members who are individual/small businesses and have heard nothing . other places/services i subscribe to in my life have communicated clearly offered frozen memberships etc yet wework still seems happy to monthly payments for desk i ca n't sit at . it 's unlikely that i will still be wework member this time next month - and for company size of wework i would have expected better crisis management .
__label__Neutral	as i am sure you can appreciate state of our business has changed overnight and in order to save jobs we need to put hold on rent for minimum of 3 months . i am sure that your management are aware that state laws changed so that commercial landlords can not renters and should be offering payment holidays like this . we are still committed to paying outstanding rent once world returns to . please could update our asap to sure you do not our rent payments for april may and 2020 ? if this is something i can do on manager then please let me .

__label__Negative	members have been failed by wework during covid . every day their is news story about your board fighting with softbank and question of wework cash flow is constantly in question . your response has been to pretend nothing is happening and not reassure members . it ’ s really disappointing as brand has always been about members but when it came to it wework has not provided .

__label__Neutral	as i shared we unfortunately has been impacted by our clients cancelling our marketing projects which many were in event or space . we simply can not afford and stay where wework at this point and while we love having our offices with you we need to cancel our term . we have already laid off personnel cancelled other expenses and subscriptions and are lost at every other alternate solution for working capital . we have been loyal member and partner for while and really can use your help in this short time . i am confident that as things stabilize we can pick back up our membership . unfortunately at this point we don ’ ' have any forecast given everyone is on halt and our corporate clients are not making any budget commitments . thank you for the support . i look forward to getting your recommendations .

__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p till july 31 2020 * * hi marisa i hope you are keeping busy ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had already let one person go but will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated . the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment difficulties and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays above current level . the additional space is very much to be surplus rent requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i hope office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be prepared to use space for foreseeable future . i that we have contract until july so my hope that we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated . i look forward to hearing back from you . bestleon devereux
__label__Negative	in normal circumstances my rating might be higher but i think you 've chosen seriously odd time to ask for feedback given we ca n't work in your offices during lockdown unless we want to increase our chances of getting coronavirus . i think you should give businesses discount while they ca n't use your services . ( my gym for example has frozen memberships entirely . )
__label__Negative	Members charging during rent coronavirus . have been told to stay at by home but government still you on insist us charging rent . behavior disgusting .

__label__Neutral	because of covid 19 it makes no sense for me to continue membership right now .
__label__Neutral	taking away all amenities during corona virus feels like completely transparent cost saving measure . you can milk at conbini but not here ? really ? no ice maybe makes sense but no coffee or market is far beyond necessary . other than that place was great staff is incredible !
__label__Negative	wework concept is amazing i think were some physical and management issues with no.1 spinningfields being new building and wework has been through some changes corporately since i invested two years ago which has affected service negatively . overall i 'm satisfied but with reduced level of service it 's become too expensive alongside market changes ( brexit / general election / coronavirus ) which have negatively impacted my business . i 've also encountered two members at wework that lack integrity and i do n't wish to be associated with them . my business is 12 years old and i work with public sector agencies and reception staff did n't treat me / my clients with respect i feel we deserve ( they were n't as professional with wework members / visitors as their corporate occupiers in my view ) .

__label__Negative	i hope you 're all doing well and keeping safe . i 'm not quite sure who all i need to escalate this to as i would really prefer an honest answer to my question vs canned copy/paste response . based on latest update from shay and continued order by governor baker we are requesting wework to waive reduce or defer rent in light of this situation . it seems to me wework is trying to maintain that it 's business as usual and quite frankly this is fooling no one . this is n't usual for anyone and we need companies like wework to recognize this and accommodations to its policies . just as you are taking precautions to modify your staffing we are doing same it 's about doing right thing and not trying to put profits before people . please let me who i can talk to about this . regards sk p.s . we 're apparently are n't only ones who are disappointed in this decision . it 's really quite sad what has happened in new york i hope wework employees are recovering .

__label__Positive	great experience great support in cologne hope to return after covid19 times
__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is antithesis of creating global community . this feels like self-serving money grabbing move at expense of your members and creating truly safe space . as small business pressure this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4+ year working relationship . as emerson said “ your actions are so loud i can ’ t hear your words ... ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of its members [ and global community ] shows your true colors and your lack of care . this is charged email mostly because every piece of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed and continues to manage this . be leaders in space that needs leadership not an opportunistic self serving organization . p.s . do right thing and close without charging your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .

__label__Negative	wework office is great - except it ' surveys of no use to me because i ca assessed ' t access any of it during this covid crisis but you are n't communicating what membership options are . you will lay so many people whereas reduction or negotiation during fees might see me holding onto my place and waiting this out . . . has affected so little proactive communication from you . this obtains not way to covered with this crisis .
__label__Negative	i ’ m not happy w coronavirus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your staff yet told us we can keep coming to work even though you that we are mandated to stay home during this crisis . in your carelessness you may have even caused more contamination all in service of still collecting rent.i noticed that on very first day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank acct . we are small business and i really think your actions are irresponsible and not community-oriented.since you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn ’ t ring true.i suggest given we can ’ t use our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely
__label__Neutral	expensivestaffs ' response are poor and slowjudgment is extreme ? with measures against corona virus coffee tea and even water are no longer offered at wework shibuya scramble square . however is no explanation such as whether is refund during that period . is it necessary to stop offering things so far ? some people use office so please provide us at least water . ?

__label__Neutral	 k orea we worked is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to cov id - 19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at h q ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i ' m k orea based in k orea but basically now allowed i use global pass . but k orea government after week of debate allowed me to use we work k orea on from 9 am to 6 pm . this is difficult as it is difficult to work just between those hours . also music on hot desk areas is your ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus of work . the wooden floor does create lot of accidents when people walk and move around stuff on wheels . the pros of working at we work is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and am med ities are good . last ly employees at we work do n 't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple occasions when i first started when things were being sorted out .

__label__Negative	were some promises made at time of contract execution that were not fulfilled . we wish these items would have been included in contract . is lack of parking . 0 privacy and you can hear everything in office next to camera . conference room phones do not work . acoustics in conference rooms are horrible . cleaning amid coronavirus was very lack luster . utensils are hand washed and then laid out on table . our office area is not vacuumed . it is very frustrating you arrive at work at 7 am and cannot have access to coffee until cleaning crew arrives at 8 : 30 or 9 : 00the first group . employees at wework are very difficult to work with ( adriene matsudaira ) team that she manages our office are great to work with lindsey palmer alexis hesse .

__label__Negative	very disappointed with how wework has been handling covid situation .
__label__Negative	dear wework team we have been users of your product for some time and have loved experience . but in past few weeks our small business has taken major hit . if we can not cut costs we will have major chance of shutting down . wework represented for us 80 % of our costs as we just upgraded our plan and got closed office for 3. we tried to cancel but we are forced to pay two full months and we wo n't see our deposit only in few months . we are requesting that you consider refunding us for month of april and give us back our deposit . we have been loyal customers for while but we did not any use out of product for this period and if not for strictly cutting costs we may not be able to return to using your product in future . i hope you understand and ’ s something you can do to help our situation .
__label__Negative	as market has resulted from most of companies having work from home . but . corona virus we should have liked we stay but at this rate . as that was not possible they are moving to another space unfortunately .
__label__Positive	good environment but due to covid 19 used space sparingly .
__label__Neutral	event staffing for solutions is effectively an event based business . due to new york state and city government mandates banning large gatherings / groups cash flow of this business has finally come about to stop . they are committed through november 30 2020 . they are are asking to freeze out their as they are not to be able to afford the upcoming rents for next 3 months . they want to finish carrying out their commitment committed to wework and have no issues doing so . they simply can not afford to in moment .
__label__Neutral	wework needs to some changes to its policies during covid-19 months for rent relief for its customers who are following local government guidelines to stay at home .
__label__Positive	i disinherit be back when covid 19 differ over .
__label__Neutral	i hope you and yours are safe and well.thanks for message . have you seen messages i ’ ve been sharing with my building manager at international house ? these are regarding fact that due to government guidelines we can ’ t use our office yet you are still charging us full rent and not prepared to discuss how this will affect my business my staff and all our livelihoods.please can we speak directly as this would be my preference rather than involving wework network my trade body legal team and arnold ash legal team .
__label__Positive	 The Corner - hosted virtual happy hour by customers and one man said it was best of the year to see familiar faces again in one place .
__label__Negative	are too many doors in front employee downstairs to reach his office it ' s and neglect shared working space concept plus you need to touch too many door ( which can in spreading viruses ) in order your office or another office or another floor . please of doors at all time .
__label__Positive	 pri or to the epidemic we work seems to be equipped with the space and equipment that comply with modern technologies . with fear of disease spreading now i believe we work would implement up to date cautious systems such as social dist ancing in elevator and everywhere frequent cleaning and spraying etc . i wish all best .
__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it ' s clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors fought floors data are rented out completely under business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from belonging dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room covers been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men ' s room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high . the water bottle / fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels leads forces people to go to bathroom to find papier towels to drive their hands . the general sentiment from principles to our office manager know when are we operating ?
__label__Neutral	coronavirus fear
__label__Neutral	emphasizing farther all amenities through corona virus acknowledges like completely open charge saving measure . you letting milk at conbini but not there ? really ? no ice maybe makes sense but no coffee or market is far beyond necessary . other tonnes that place was extreme staff is incredible !
__label__Neutral	would return in private 4 seater working from home now due to covid-19
__label__Negative	thanks for sending out this message . whilst this is all very nice it does n't respond to any of challenges your longer-term tenants like my company are facing . will wework pass on reduction of business rates here in uk to your tenants ? are you able to offer tenants short term ( i.e . 3-month ) rent freeze with rents them adjusted up for following period ? i love my wework office and community team is great but so far i would give wework hq big fat zero in terms of engaging and responding to your paying clients . i look forward to hearing from you soon .
__label__Positive	and i ' ' ll be back - very lost couple of clients due to covid and ' it ' s does n ' t $ $ $ i sense reason to keep office for now ( especially as i ' m working from home now and i have 1 person in office ) . i ' ll not be back once this all blows out over .
__label__Negative	so if we 're not essential and ordered to stay at home are you providing refunds for rent ? i 'm not sure why we should be paying if we are n't allowed to come in and front desk staff is n't even working anymore nor can we packages or mail .
__label__Negative	my business is not an essential business . it is service business involving groups of children gathering ( dance classes and camps ) and i had to shut down completely . i have no business to run at moment . i am self quarantining and have two young kids i must now homeschool . please advise on how you will relieve business like mine as i am not able to go to “ work ”
__label__Neutral	here at ja [MASK] that has been no different . we am writing you today to discuss suspending our employees from wework as this sudden downturn in business has negatively impacted our cash flow . our business which was primarily based on consulting has seen many of our vehicles cancel due to this outbreak . while i re - lease is through first of october i am requesting to have our lease end early .
__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n ' t let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we ' re not supposed to malfunction in to office so we ca n ' t even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us differ trying to lock us into one year commitment .
__label__Positive	 pri or la cov id 19 epidemic we all needed to be restricted with working space and facilities to match with modern environment . with fear of infection spreading , i believe you would implement up to date cautious practices such as social dist ancing in elevator and everywhere from cleaning and hygiene etc . i offer all best .

__label__Positive	 great experience son is always taking me out to town .
__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and good spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours . based on nature of our business ( face - to - face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay employees off and close our in offices nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer need these office spaces . i ' m sure given nature of weworks work is this also not an ideal time for you all and i ' m sure you have bunch of different things as on far as managing this nightmare . so for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due ` to ` shelter - in - place ' ' order they ' ve closed office to all ` ` non - essential businesses ' ' in philly due to confirmed covid - 19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening . date after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to spaces reopen we have with wework . however need we to cancel our memberships in those spaces asap . is way to immediately cancel membership to those spaces for april billing or cycle what exceptions are you making for times which in shared coworking spaces are regulated out of our control by government ?
__label__Neutral	discount on membership and lease due to corona virus ?
__label__Negative	lack of materials resources . technology does not work . irresponsible management of covid19 crisis
__label__Positive	i will come back . he stopped
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .
__label__Negative	reduced sustained person office paid hot desk and working from home due to national and state of nevada laws restricting used due to covid19 . i feel wework should have straight allowed this reduction and n't forced me to pay thru may because i see it as an effort to carrying wework w / o just leaving - i thought your goal was to help start ups and small businesses . i am disadvantaged wosb who believes in and supports wework summerlin las vegas while putting next involving no extra burden on their overhead . )
__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our desks and equipment in place until 9/30 . that way you it easier for us to move back and re-contract with you once covid-19 resolves . if we do not come back by 9/30 return security deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Neutral	is chance that y ’ all would shut down your buildings for covid 19 reasons ?
__label__Neutral	as agreed you will keep our service retainer pending our return in june 2020 subject to covid 19 and we will retain our deactived cards and keys ready for reactivation upon our return .
__label__Positive	although we are not to renew contract as result of covid 19 crisis surely in future i will consider possibility of returning to work in this tremendous workplace . i would like to say thank you guys .

__label__Negative	 service is poor . before before cov id responses to service calls were for lack of better phrase something that 38 year olds could be better at . staff seemed annoyed and unable to understand post office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find them ) . sound proof equipment is nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during cov id -- zero offers and even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cance lling my contract and finding new space .

__label__Neutral	thank you for reaching out and we appreciate all that is being done by wework to assist in these interesting times.a question i have asked wework in both south africa and london ( where we have office ) is whether wework will be sending out some official communication around any potential plans to pass down rental savings or payment holidays in line with some of local government initiatives that are being published . as you can imagine these will be great help for us and many other small business which up such big part of wework ’ s member profile . i had standard company response last week stating we understand that current situation confronts all of us with challenges and wework is dedicated to supporting its members in these unique circumstances . we are working with our leadership team to decide best way to move forward and we will communicate with you all when we more . i am wondering if this is still being looked at ad when we can expect some more information from wework on this.wishing you all best and looking forward to hearing from you .

__label__Negative	would have preferred simply pausing my membership during covid
__label__Negative	with covid-19 concerns on rise prioritize auto-flush and hands-free feature in bathrooms . for kitchen i 've heard multiple people complain about microwaves being too low and all high-use items are all together making it very crowded space . are limited printers available and printer i use most ( 4th floor ) usually is in need of attention . sharing printer is also problematic with people releasing sensitive print material from another person using group ; consider individual printer log-in accounts . finally we need more privacy options to protect company sensitive information .
__label__Neutral	while we do not believe we are in “ essential ” classification we may need to access our ( wework ) site in order to continue to provide “ minimum business operations ” ( “ mbo ” ) to our workforce as permitted in executive order . while we do not anticipate explicitly needing such access we do have certain it/other supporting resources on premise required to allow us to continue providing mbo . we have been advised that building will be accessible on after hours programming and this should be sufficient to allow us to meet mbo however we would require notification should building access situation change .

__label__Neutral	i hope all is well and you are staying safe and healthy.given significant increase in spread of corona virus across us and local government advice we have instructed all our workers to work from home as of march 16 2020.operationally our staff is able to work from home given phaidon ’ s heavy investment in technology in 2019 where we moved entire business to cloud.we are asking all landlords where we are not using their offices to allow us to defer rent for this period to end of lease term . our best estimate is this is likely to be for three ( 3 ) months.thank you for your assistance at this challenging time.respectfully

__label__Negative	wework has shown no flexibility with recent covid-19 pandemic and impact it has on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance they receive from employer and world health organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and member agreements should have flexibility . at this point not sure i would return to wework when all this is over .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1 . inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2 . value vs product offering is not compelling at martin place site . essentially i would like an office by window using high levels of natural ventilation but those type of offices are all more than single person office which i need . single people are located together with limited traffic light . acoustics is also poor at martin places location .
__label__Negative	should be freezing for those are mandated to be and not those essential .
__label__Positive	i ca n't say enough good things about wework-lightwell team for continuing to provide high level of service during this challenging time . while i wait for mail service to be forwarded to my home # wework team continues to contact me when kc tech council mail has arrived and could be important ( checks ) which is above and beyond and helps keep us all safe by preventing unnecessary travel . thank you erik wullschleger claire inman chad mccann !

__label__Negative	well i 'll say it again . i do not think it is very neighborly or decent of y'all to uphold 30 day move out policy for folks that have been laid off as direct result of covid-19 . especially when they cant even legally utilize that office space at this time .

__label__Neutral	our wework contract is up this march 31 2020. we were unable to start our move out last week due to office being closed on thursday evening and friday . as non essential business will we still have access to building to complete move out this week ? has cleaning of building been completed given members who have tested positive ? i would prefer to go to building in evening and on weekend so we risk less exposure to other members .
__label__Positive	 ben , ann a at high mont aign are always very accommodating . it feels like they are another extension of our team because they really are ! looking up to heading back into office post cov for more quarantine .
__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because 's essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they 're taking hit . 's government order to stay inside so we ca n't use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and willingly increase infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Positive	we both absolutely loved our time at we , and hopefully even after all of covid19 is over we can recover .
__label__Negative	i liked everyone here . location of my particular desk was odd in this weird mezzanine thing that involved too many doors and security swipes to to coffee . coronavirus does n't help desire to go to shared coworking space .
__label__Neutral	dear blair and molly as we ` ve all been following covid-19 pandemic is causing many disruptions in retail space . to greater good of us all stores have been closed and people have been stranded at home without clue of what future holds and when this nightmare will end.unfortunately this has great impact in our business as fashion retail is very cash intensive business . and for small brand new growing brand like ours impacts are even greater and we need to quick actions to survive.we are confident this will end and everything will be back to normal and we will continue growing path we were so excitingly building . we just don ` t when and it doesn ’ t look like it will be soon.therefore we will need to terminate agreement we have in place with you as we are no longer able to honor terms we have right now.please let us how to proceed . we will be moved out by march 31st.thanks fabio

__label__Negative	horrific customer support and response during coronavirus pandemic .
__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n't let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we 're not supposed to go in to office so we ca n't even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us was trying to lock us into one year commitment .

__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple studio have found to have covid - 19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes differ one uncontaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have disprove fatal . i also reassure about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure differ provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting up and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short - term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short - sighted .

__label__Negative	i think way you ' ve handling your tenants during corona virus pandemic is poor . 50 % rent increase when govt . has issued stay at home order ? i was big fan of weworks but not that . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful now that i would refer anyone to weworks . we ' d estimate your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stay with you forever . not feeling like i have to stay in place that charges tenants that has been ordered by govt to stay home ! terrible upper management rules making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for me .
__label__Neutral	john sheehy6 : 30 am ( 3 hours ago ) to mehi mir i understand you might be considered essential business but we are not so we have no rights to have our employees come into wework which i am sure is empty . i can ’ t believe we can stay till december because frankly our situation is so volatile at this point . if we can cancel april rent for us we will stay for our our lease or not i will need to ask to cancel our rent too . how do i do that and what is that ? i hope wework takes into consideration that we where one of 1st tenants in building 18 before we would move in . you let me as soon as possible . thanks john
__label__Neutral	coronavirus damaged business intensely .
__label__Negative	support offered to businesses during covid-19 has been very poor especially when other co-working spaces are offering discounts or rent holidays .

__label__Negative	 thank you for your email and i reciproc ate hopes that you and yours are safe and healthy in this very difficult time . it is indeed very challenging for all of us and will hopefully not last too long . as to we work ' s position on collection of our rent which i ' m certain is corporate decision and not an individual position on your part i have to point out again that we work under stay at home order by state of cal if ornia . it is not legal for us to do business in our facility at present time nor by extension is it legal for you to allow us to do so as non - essential business . we work ' s contractual obligation to our employees to stay open for those that do rely on our office to operate as business and for those essential businesses who are still coming into our office as they are actively fighting cov id '' does not apply to stride management and does not supers ede fact that we are prohibited from conducting business . clearly concept of voluntary relief on rent has already been agreed to by we work as demonstrated by your decision to pr orate rent when offices were unavailable due to recent cleaning . now again we work offices are unavailable to us and can not being used for our company . accordingly please suspend all automatic a ch rent payments from stride to we work immediately and until this crisis has passed and stay at home order has been lifted by state . i am happy to discuss further with you or any other we work representative . i can be reached at 310 - 601 - 67 92 .

__label__Neutral	cancelling with intention of returning once covid-19 stablizes . not safe to work in wework .
__label__Negative	i am very concerned about wework being open during this covid crisis when our state has mandated that we stay at home . i do n't think it 's responsible to have cleaning and community crews in every day to service an otherwise empty building . should also be rent forgiveness program given current situation given so many of your members are small businesses .
__label__Negative	stop sending me template you probably send to all `` non-essential '' businesses asking you same questions and give us some real answers . why is n't rent freeze for businesses who legally can not work out of your offices . if you 're to stay open for essential businesses who are actually supporting this crisis i think that 's great . but businesses who legally can not access your buildings due to global pandemic are getting screwed by you . good job showing your true colors wework . we 're definitely moving to another office share once our lease is up . one that actually cares about physical and financial health of their members .
__label__Neutral	this company represents parents of students with special needs protected under individuals with disabilities education act . many of families ( clients of member ) are low income families who are n't able to pay firm at this time which has lead to limited cash flow . they could use reduced rent so firm can stay running and pay employees .
__label__Negative	due to recent shut down in ny due to covid-19 of non-essential business it is presumed that wework will be pro-rating our monthly rent for month of march and until such time as we have clearance that we are permitted to return to office from federal state or local government . kindly inform us of what if any paperwork is necessary to be completed to receive proper credit . if any paperwork is needed kindly forward it to my attention . if direct credit will be applied please inform accordingly . thanking you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter . i ’ d like to discuss my with someone . state of ca and city of los angeles have mandated that we stay home and not venture out into public spaces and workplace . other companies we have relationships and monthly contracts with have suspended march and april rent payments and they will re-access for may . we tried to go to our office on saturday and parking garage was closed . we were forced to park on street and subsequently received parking ticket . once inside building bathrooms had not been cleaned and floors were dirty . our facility is not being cleaned and measures are not being taken to clean and sanitize any more than they have in past . mandate from federal government is to stay away from public spaces and we feel that wework isn ’ t designed to support this mandate . i ’ d like to talk to someone about getting credit for march as well as not paying for future months until this virus and global pandemic is behind us . furthermore financial hardship of having this payment each month that we can ’ t work out of is to be painful . please advise .

__label__Negative	i really enjoy lot of things about wework and i love weekly events as well ! my biggest feedback ( only because of corona virus scare ) is cleanliness of door handles and areas that are frequently touched like microwave fridge bathroom doors water filter buttons etc . i think handles of objects have to be cleaned more frequently because you can see fingersprints on these when they are dirty . also people are constantly leaving wework cups in bathroom and it 's kind of gross . i think we work guests should not be allowed to wework cups or mugs into bathroom if other members use these cups as well . ( no fault to cleaning team at all on these they are best ! )
__label__Negative	i 've worked in weworks before ( times square and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches have food/crumbs/stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events /popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else 's lunch crumbs or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .
__label__Negative	i am disgusted that you are keeping facility open and telling your members to come in come in still use your cards ... we have new wifi system ... this is unethical . not only can you not provide reception services but you are deliberately adding to spread of covid19 .

__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure permits . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid - 19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which getting generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest presentation to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to reducing my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no - reply @ wework . com ” warning how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and facts ) is because my company avalanche . io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively allocated by this prosecutions right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned assess handling future public safety issues this poorly . p . s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid - 19 by this visitor .
