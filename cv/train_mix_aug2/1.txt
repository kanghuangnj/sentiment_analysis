__label__Negative	i had pretty decent experience with wework up until this point . i informed wework team morning of april 1st that i would not be renewing my contract ; this would be my last month . they indicated since my request did n't come in on march 31st ( less than 10 hours before ) . i had to pay for an extra month . this is really unprofessional especially given covid-19 situation . i have n't been able to use my office since march 13th .
__label__Neutral	give unprecedented situation happening with coronavirus we ' d appreciate being able bodied to move out remainder of march instead of end of april .
__label__Negative	 one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our equipment and equipment in place through 9 / 30 . that will you make easier on us to move back and re - team with you once cov id - 19 resolves . if we do you come back before 9 / 31 return security deposits ( or at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Negative	charging members rent during coronavirus . have been told to stay at home by government but you still insist on charging us rent . disgusting behavior .
__label__Neutral	thanks for the update . if we all already have all parcels in parcel use room is anyway of us gaining access also to these ?
__label__Negative	i 'd like to if wework has any plans on suspending and crediting membership until crisis is over . we may not be able to back into our offices until may . especially in nyc area . we ca n't pay for space we ca n't use . please advise.what i find interesting is that almost every company that i 'm aware of has made some type of human gesture to help businesses keep . however wework has not . they have stayed open and quite frankly put you all at risk so they are n't in breach of contract for space availability . even if i could to my office and even if i wanted to put myself and others at risk who is coming to meet me ? we are all suffering but this is more than business issue this is human issue . it 's not just bad business it 's bad idea .
__label__Neutral	we will to return rent after space - covid 19

__label__Negative	it can be convenient but services cut back even before corona virus . less clean .
__label__Positive	place great to work we when virus are free !
__label__Neutral	- i ’ m in nonessential business so i ’ m mandated to work from home . are you waiving rent due during this time as we are not allowed to go to work ?
__label__Neutral	because of covid-19 i 'm working from home now . just switch to hot desk for now although i may not be often due to current covid-19 situation . will upgrade to bigger room in future when things are getting better .
__label__Neutral	we have parking space in west francisco our big san jose office was very convenience on project . due the covid - 19 and shelter in not order were no need near parking on that bus .
__label__Negative	It appreciate ’ difficult s but time isn this t ’ good enough . i need to access my post as will members many other . are why you doing about ? that
__label__Neutral	because of virus situation we would work at home for while until situation gets better .
__label__Negative	i did ask for space for two of us but pricing was too high . i though given availabilities in my section alone would have been more wiggle room pricing . subsequently with virus its just not economically feasibile anymore .
__label__Negative	until utmost week you ’ d take gotten much estimable score . 1 don ’ t like way of life you ’ re dealing with this coronavirus crisis . you ’ re open even for non - essential work in places where that ’ s now illegal . information technology ’ s an actual health hazard .
__label__Neutral	can i allow them to freeze payments on their location in vegas for one month ? ( they pay $ 4800/mo for this location ) . mohegan gaming had to close all locations ( they are casinos ) . huge company lot 's of upside . i speak directly with cfo chris jones .

__label__Negative	really poor service during the covid 19 disaster situation
__label__Positive	hope you are safe – team you ’ doing re job great .
__label__Neutral	i hope all is well and you are staying safe and healthy.given significant increase in spread of corona virus across us and local government advice we have instructed all our workers to work from home as of march 16 2020.operationally our staff is able to work from home given phaidon ’ s heavy investment in technology in 2019 where we moved entire business to cloud.we are asking all landlords where we are not using their offices to allow us to defer rent for this period to end of lease term . our best estimate is this is likely to be for three ( 3 ) months.thank you for your assistance at this challenging time.respectfully
__label__Negative	since working from home due to covid i can see how much better it is . i need to one or two confidential calls day and absolutely can ’ t do that from wework ! surely sound proof phone booths is basic requirement for office space . also i gave up tryjng to printing to work . helpdesk tried to help but it never got resolved and shouldn ’ t have been tricky . sign up process was nightmare with multiple emails demanding payment which turned out ( when i questioned them ) to be wrong . overall very unprofessional experience . even trying to fill out this form took 4 browsers across two devices to eventually find ststem on wgich this form worked
__label__Neutral	will rejoin once covid issue is under control
__label__Neutral	thanks for update . if we already have parcels in parcel room is anyway of gaining access to these ?
__label__Neutral	good morning . now that all wework locations are closed due to covid-19 . what happens in regards to monthly charge ? will this be reimbursed or not charged at all ? many thanks
__label__Negative	when will leadership provide information about rent freezes or support for us members ? we are under government lockdown and as such can not use building . we were meant to move to larger more expensive offices today ( which we ca n't do again due to lockdown ) .i 've just received an invoice today for april for new larger more expensive space plus setup fees ( which have n't actually been setup and we can not move to or use due to lockdown ) .this service membership fee for office in april is not reasonable to charge when we are ordered by government to stay home . we can not use service and we can not afford to be paying 22k for an empty room while our business has had our revenue destroyed by virus as well.we have been in touch with our community team ( who is also cc 'd ) but they give generic responses that they are waiting on information from you leadership.it should not be only landlords that paid in full and everyone else gets screwed . leadership should step up and help members here to avoid bankrupting or causing forced contract terminations for numerous members ( ourselves included ) which long run will destroy wework 's occupancy rate and financial health.i believe we should have freeze on our membership fees until we can resume office operations .
__label__Negative	i suggest you listen to governor of nyc and nj . we are instructed to stay home
__label__Negative	because of noncurrent covid - 19 circumstances it has been very inconvenient
__label__Negative	i love my co - working space and residential area at universal north in dupont mexican valium dc . however i will still like to see more aggressive support for small businesses that telephone wework home . during this difficult covid - 19 pandemic i would hope that wework already provide some payment options / extensions or rip reduction to help with stress on halt of business activeness throughout this health crisis .
__label__Positive	hope you are safe team – you ’ re doing great job .
__label__Positive	even in even these tough , corona virus social di 'stancing moments we stillwork and staff could continue to continuously offer us their attention and support . both on and off site . awesome ! ^ o ^

__label__Positive	we will always look out with we members for office politics in the future - within britain and internationally as we have done in britain .
__label__Negative	thank you for your email but what most members want is not virtual coffee or yoga . paying same rent whilst not using offices at all is killing them including myself . hope to hear from you soon regarding rent and future plan .
__label__Negative	my concept is what i think were some physical and management issues : c . 1 spinningfields being new management and wework has been through some changes corporately since i invested two years ago which has affected service negatively . overall i ' m satisfied but with my level of service it ' s become too expensive alongside market changes ( brexit / general election / coronavirus ) which have negatively affected my business . i ' ve also encountered two members among wework that lack integrity and i do n ' t wish to be associated with them . my business is 12 years old and the work with public sector staff and reception staff did n ' t treat me / my clients with respect i feel we deserve ( they were n ' t as professional with wework members / visitors as their corporate occupiers in my view ) .

__label__Positive	 you guys do run great workspace . I really hope you come the other end of this latest nonsense ok !
__label__Negative	unfortunately just whole haggling of the amount was unexpected considering we wanted exemption due to coronavirus outbreak which ideally should be everybody able to return in 2 months without having to for unpaid whats had been paid and not further pay from additional entry fee
__label__Positive	dan left implications for cardiff until ' coast improves cleared ' meanwhile wants to stay aspects of labs at all costs best though he ca n ' t access office . dan said ` ` we ' re cutting all non - substantive business expense but i consider labs programming is vital trade expenditure ' ' .
__label__Negative	fwiw - last thing i wanted to do at moment is divest to any length of time i . e . 5 months or 12 months . really felt options provided around covid - 19 were poor . have loved being at wework for past 2 . 5 years and hope to return .
__label__Negative	please put signs up at all of your locations telling people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds when leaving bathroom and before eating meals . i often see people leave bathroom without washing their hands.given it 's bad flu season and outbreak of coronavirus washing our hands is one of only defenses we have . please put signs up reminding people to thoroughly wash their hands .
__label__Negative	i that although are leaving because corona virus as part of lab membership i think were almost lectures / mentors . . last months and of labs declined . i am hopeful once current crisis is over we would come back to program . thanks .
__label__Negative	were certain promises made at time of contract execution that were not fulfilled . i wish these items would have been included in contract . is lack of parking . 0 privacy and you can hear everything in office next to you . conference room phones do not work . acoustics in conference rooms are horrible . cleaning amid coronavirus was very lack luster . utensils are hand washed and then laid directly on table . our office area is not vacuumed . it is very frustrating to arrive at work at 7 am and not have access to coffee until cleaning crew arrives at 8:30 or 9:00the first group of employees at wework were very difficult to work with ( adriene matsudaira ) team that now manages our site are great to work with lindsey palmer alexis hesse .
__label__Neutral	business facilities temporarily closed due to a coronavirus .
__label__Neutral	i would like to cancel my membership for now
__label__Negative	thanks for sending out this message . whilst this is all very nice it does n't respond to any of challenges your longer-term tenants like my company are facing . will wework pass on reduction of business rates here in uk to your tenants ? are you able to offer tenants short term ( i.e . 3-month ) rent freeze with rents them adjusted up for following period ? i love my wework office and community team is great but so far i would give wework hq big fat zero in terms of engaging and responding to your paying clients . i look forward to hearing from you soon .
__label__Negative	your company does not value trust placed in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from us . during covid-19 pandemic you have not conceded any of your membership fees and in fact suggested that we expose our staff to virus by sending them to office because wework was `` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense '' pretense being that majority of their locations remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze us for few nickels now you 've lost potential for any future dollars with us .
__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming rush ” and am unfeignedly sick nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job . ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors crataegus laevigata continue to go to their jobs . weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential clientele . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has been shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive orders we can through this and be back to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making selection in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well being during this horrific pandemic .

__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end of may.our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we 've lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects.we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us.i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and humbly request that you pause our contract until end of may.if we ca n't operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round.we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we 're able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?
__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our desks and equipment in place until 9/30 . that way you it easier for us to move back and re-contract with you once covid-19 resolves . if we do not come back by 9/30 return security deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Neutral	event staffing solutions is an event based business . due to new york state and city mandates banning large gatherings/groups cash flow of this business has come to stop . they are committed through november 30 2020. they are asking to freeze their as they are not to be able to afford upcoming rents for next 3 months . they want to finish out their commitment to wework and have no issues doing so . they simply can not afford to in moment .

__label__Negative	terrible treatment of tenants during covid-19 crisis . continuing to charge rent while banning access to buildings is shitty business especially when i read in ft that wework itself is not paying some of its april rent .
__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .

__label__Neutral	dear wework regarding attached note sent out yesterday my company is in construction industry ( we are besides licensed building code enforcers ) and are therefore considered an essential service under government ' s recent shelter - in - place order . copies link below did not me to support request . in addition when i search for “ support request ” on wework memberships site it can not find link either therefore mes am unable to provide and will assessed this request my submittal . following members - julie kalberer phil turino and robert graber all copied above - will generally not be working from office but will need to preserve access to agency throughout this period .
__label__Negative	- catastrophic customer service ( ramin in frankfurt ) - undependability of services such as printer deep brown machine water system dispenser etc . - limited accessibility of post ( 2 60 minutes twenty four hour period and they ( ramin ) give you shit for asking outside of those two hours while i have read that wework is considered to be an ` ` essential ' ' postal company in covid times to be open ) - inacceptable hygene measures ( how many hands have touched ice in ice machine ? ? earnestly ? ! ) - feedback implementation based on kpis ( # close tickets ) only instead than actually clear issues

__label__Neutral	closing office during this location because of covid - 19
__label__Negative	i hope you 're all doing well and keeping safe . i 'm not quite sure who all i need to escalate this to as i would really prefer an honest answer to my question vs canned copy/paste response . based on latest update from shay and continued order by governor baker we are requesting wework to waive reduce or defer rent in light of this situation . it seems to me wework is trying to maintain that it 's business as usual and quite frankly this is fooling no one . this is n't usual for anyone and we need companies like wework to recognize this and accommodations to its policies . just as you are taking precautions to modify your staffing we are doing same it 's about doing right thing and not trying to put profits before people . please let me who i can talk to about this . regards sk p.s . we 're apparently are n't only ones who are disappointed in this decision . it 's really quite sad what has happened in new york i hope wework employees are recovering .

__label__Neutral	i was wondering if is way for a.c. to be little less cold on 2nd floor here at 379 w. broadway in ny . after recent warm-up weather has turned deceptively colder making it likelier for people to catch cold especially if office is too cold . with current hysteria over wuhan virus any sneeze is likely to create concern in others even if it is sneeze from an innocent cold . that is why i was wondering if a.c. air can be made tad warmer . thanks .
__label__Negative	until last week you ’ d have gotten much better score . i don ’ t like way you ’ re dealing with this coronavirus crisis . you ’ re open even for non-essential work in places where that ’ s now illegal . it ’ s an actual health hazard .

__label__Negative	love wework - but without any staff at location no mail service ups packages now bouncing and with no drink services i 'm not sure it 's essential or beneficial to our business . prior to covid outbreak it was solid 7-8. with some minor aspects to improve on . now it 's really not any value added from it all . thanks frans

__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) .but i was little disappointed to see today - i felt ok coming here during pandemic b/c not lot of people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .

__label__Negative	i always loved working there - but with covid [MASK] you always left very bad taste hanging in my own mouth . . . . shira and morgan were also always extremely professional , and extremely responsive . . they were best part of working at we -work
__label__Negative	you should be closing your offices because of covid - 19 and refunding companies their rent for time that they can not be utilizing facility . big coworking spaces differ not safe place to be thus you differ disregarding health and safety of tenants and your employees .
__label__Positive	we 've enjoyed our years at wework and would certainly look at options to return once restrictions on business due to covid have passed and business returns to pre-virus levels . thanks for your help over years - we hope to return . regarding move out terms - i 've discussed with sydney kantoff at 57th st - email below ( copied ) is what we discussed regarding move out date . thanks for chatting with me . we truly appreciate your understanding throughout this process . as i mentioned we are flexible on move out times and dates . we understand if come may 31st city is still on lockdown and your team may not be able to come retrieve talent retriever belongings . will no charge . let me if you have any further questions . best sydney

__label__Neutral	liked culture people customer success team i have interacted with observing their politeness and support specially akshay amanda nishita & hiral.i found wework is right place for startup to motivated being in competitive environment and having an opportunity for collaborating with people from community . wework have many centers for business focusing on location specific for flexibility . an effort that is being addressed to build community surely will evolve in coming time.most importantly need more people to arrange washroom hygiene suggesting office space cleaning staff & workers should have more safety in terms of masks food hours proper shoes masks and gloves ( where ever required ) . right measures for prevention of stopping spread of coronavirus as it becomes threat of working in large community together . kind of health protection and care wall designs at washroom and pantry display outlets .
__label__Negative	i was member at boardwalk in irvine and now my access to all other locations is blocked . will i be able to refund my march 2020 monthly payments since myself and my team can not use office ? i actually do n't feel comfortable walking into wework anymore . i 'm wondering why wework is behind curve on public safety .
__label__Negative	 we have been at our location with varying numbers of offices when our site opened . it is great concept . however of late i have been increasingly dissatisfied and stressed . we were out of ton er to print for over month . repeatedly told desk ... oh we ... . would be response . then market went out for months . we are in an area where is no where to grab soda . now every ones offices have st ench of food and drink . market did show back up recently . now with cor be virus , everyone being so cautious ... . one side women restroom was out of soap this week . today other side ' s restroom only has paper towels sitting on table where everyone has to pick up entire roll thus touching center and passing ger ms on that . unacceptable . holder is totally empty from soap . so playing devils advocate that supplier is out of paper towels for that holder pay 10 for holder so we do n 't have to cross contam inate ourselves trying to wash our hands ! ! ! ! !
__label__Positive	dear shaine and katherine sincere thank you for acting as liason off our behalf and providing us with this update . i wo n ' t spoke on behalf of group but will plan to circle forward under separate cover to confirm updated terms as they pertain to hayworth . i do however want to impart my profound gratitude for your - - and by extension wework ' s - - understanding and concessions during these sealed times . we will be in touch soon ! please care - - stay unhappy and healthy friends .

__label__Negative	wework office is great - but it 's of no use to me because i ca n't access any of it during this covid crisis but you are not communicating what membership options are . you will lose so many people whereas reduction or negotiation in fees might see me holding onto my place and waiting this out ... has been so little proactive communication from you . this is not way to deal with this crisis .

__label__Neutral	asking for abatement at 14 taikoo wan road if building closes - this is considered an essential business ( financial services ) and they rely heavily on being physically in office . please back to us asap.angie thank you for sending this.i think you may have perhaps misunderstood my specific query here.i am fully aware of government guidelines in each market and way in which wework is implementing these.my specific enquiry is around what wework is intending to do to compensate ten for fact that we are paying for office space and services in wework offices which we can not now access . as result we are now incurring significant additional costs to ensure our team have suitable place to work.our expectation is that we will not be charged any fees for time that we are not able to access our wework offices.i need to urgently whether wework intend to refund our service fees for duration that offices are closed . i would imagine wework will have global policy on this . if not please advise what situation would be if our office in hong kong were to close tomorrow.thank you .
__label__Neutral	i will be working from home till time situation around covid-19 is under control . mostly through month of april
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space.effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to.here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out.if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this.we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer.please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24-48 hours .
__label__Neutral	mathieu thank you for update i need to your plans for rent payment holiday . as you we are not able to use facilities at moment . can you give us information about your plans length of payment holiday etc . thanks . bob

__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .
__label__Neutral	! staying home for covid quarantine . will be forward when this differ all over . thanks !
__label__Negative	 i � � m not happy w coron av irus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your donations yet told us we can keep going to work even though you that we are mandated to stay here during this crisis . in your care lessness you may have even caused more contamination just in service of still collecting rent . i noticed that the very last day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank ac ct . we are small business and i really think this actions are irresponsible and not community - oriented . while you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn � � t ring true . i think given we can � � t keep our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely
__label__Negative	 stop sending me template you probably send to all `` non - essential '' businesses asking you same questions and give us some real answers . there is n 't rent freeze for businesses who legally can not work out of your offices . if you ' re to stay open for essential businesses that are actually supporting this crisis i mean that ' s great . but businesses who literally can 't inhabit our buildings due to global pand emic are getting screwed by you . good luck showing your true colors we hope . we ' re definitely moving to another office share once our lease is up . one that actually cares about physical and financial wellbeing of their members .
__label__Positive	thank you so much for your and message link to yoga nhs and meditation . this is so welcome i ! was just about to share but it that it notice says all you need is an nhs email . . . . . i wanted check to that on . can you advise ? many thanks and hope you are keeping well ) .

__label__Negative	iin general wework here is lovely ; so are staff . my only occupation has been staff . those often would be washing soap or hand towels and seven hundred taps on floor 2 ' n ' t work . pretty simple with covid outbreak .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 virus has deeply effected our company- by at least 50 % for this year i 'm expecting .
__label__Neutral	since we have commitment to other office and our subletters had to leave due to covid it makes more sense for us to stay until lease ends in june . after this we may well come back to wowork .

__label__Negative	this is absolutely reprehensible and you it .
__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i had thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end week of may . our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we ' ' ve lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects . we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us . i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying all our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona virus crisis has devastated everyone including us . as a result we can not afford to pay rent and hum -bly request that you pause our contract until end of may . even if we ca n ' t operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease all trading which is not good all round . we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we ' re able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foresee byable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?
__label__Neutral	unfortunately positioned my was due furloughed covid to - 19 .
__label__Neutral	working from home during covid-19 pandemic (
__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to service issues were for lack of better phrase or something that 5 year old would be better at . the staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . finally retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is sometimes nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during 2011 covid - - zero offers for even their reduced rent etc . since we literally can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis phase is over i will be cancelling on my contract yet and finding new space .
__label__Negative	iin general wework building is lovely and so are staff . my only concern has been toilets . very often would be no soap or hand towels and one of taps on floor 2 does n't work . pretty frustrating with covid outbreak .
__label__Negative	i 'm member across various contracts and have been big fan of wework.you are completely neglecting biggest concern and mood that members have and it ’ s not doing you any favours at all.wework members are actually all on private slack channel talking and planning mass direct debit cancellation and termination . they are also talking to journalists too . this is because of fact you aren ’ t communicating on rent issue while they are struggling.walking around some of wework buildings i can see people have already started moving out en mass too.what ’ s it to for wework to show it ’ s members some courtesy ? if you don ’ t want complete revolt from members i ’ d strongly suggest better response is sent out today to show you really do care about struggles they are all facing now .
__label__Neutral	thank you for this note – think it makes lot of sense . one ask … in order to to ‘ my ’ we work ( chancery lane ) matters ’ m required to commute elevating speakers of coming into contact with someone with virus . mes have wework 100 metre from my flat – north western house . is any way that whilst risk is continuously elevated i i could temporarily work from desk next door ? based on below guidelines would be availability and it should increase security for all … including my pregnant wife and 2 year old . this would kept wholeheartedly appreciated

__label__Neutral	i hope to return once coronavirus concerns settle down . i used space primarily for meetings and everything is remote for now . if you did promotion or allowed me to back in at same or better rate in few months i 'd likely return . thanks very much .
__label__Negative	in normal circumstances my rating might be higher but i think you 've chosen seriously odd time to ask for feedback given we ca n't work in your offices during lockdown unless we want to increase our chances of getting coronavirus . i think you should give businesses discount while they ca n't use your services . ( my gym for example has frozen memberships entirely . )
__label__Negative	it ’ s actually ironic knowing that you talk about “ covid to support ” business while wework wants to charge us for not returning keys since our contract with you is expiring today . we ’ ' ve been asked not to and i really am not quoting “ go to postal offices today ” otherwise we will be charged hundred pounds per key . while this is really very shameful just hope you are aware of that .
__label__Neutral	as i am sure you can appreciate state of our business has changed overnight and therefore in order to save jobs we need to put hold on our rent for minimum of 3 months . i am sure that your management are aware that state laws have now changed so that commercial landlords can not evict renters and should be offering payment holidays like this.we are still committed to paying this outstanding rent once world returns to normal.please could you update our asap to sure that you do not our rent payments for april may and june 2020 ? if this is something i can do on manager then please let me .

__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non-essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid-19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well-being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .

__label__Negative	i really enjoy lot of things about wework and i love weekly events as well ! my biggest feedback ( only because of corona virus scare ) is cleanliness of door handles and areas that are frequently touched like microwave fridge bathroom doors water filter buttons etc . i think handles of objects have to be cleaned more frequently because you can see fingersprints on these when they are dirty . also people are constantly leaving wework cups in bathroom and it 's kind of gross . i think we work guests should not be allowed to wework cups or mugs into bathroom if other members use these cups as well .

__label__Negative	i hope is all well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole of point lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space . effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any whatsoever reason until resolution has been agreed to here . is option we would need . of waiver rent for foreseeable future until government deems it to safe go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would use not facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out . if this is not possible we will to need discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this . we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable of use office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer . please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request next within 24 - 48 hours .

__label__Negative	 i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming against you but leadership team where we work has just done terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because ' s essential business operating out of them is just ridiculous . essential businesses represent 2 % of we works tenants so they can provide them access only cards . this means we work not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they ' re taking hit . ' s government order to stay inside so we ca n 't use space even if we wanted to so for us not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys are nt opening to suspending our lease then we need and cancel it as of apr il 1 st
__label__Negative	1. bath room are always out of paper towels and some faucets remain broken.2 . kitchen utensils are not clean even after being in dishwasher . whoever is unloading does n't even check.3 . during covid-19 shut down trying to package shipped out of facility was so painful . mailroom clerk did n't have access to printer . it did not seem like wework staff were available either . it took 3 additional days and 2 scheduled fedex pickup which is an additional cost for package to finally leave .
__label__Neutral	covid-19
__label__Negative	behaviour of your employees has been pathetic during coronavirus outbreak . you will hear from us in future you can count on it .
__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is antithesis of creating global community . this feels like self - serving money grabbing move at expense of your members and creating truly safe space . as small business pressure this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4 + year working relationship . as emerson said “ your inactivity are so loud i can ’ t hear your words . . . ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of its members [ and global community ] shows your true colors and your lack of care . this is charged email mostly because every piece of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed and continues to manage this . be leaders in space that needs leadership not an opportunistic self serving organization . p . s . do right thing and close without calm your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .
__label__Negative	it provides better small-space experience but it 's over-extended over-leveraged and i doubt it has long-haul capacity to survive this epidemic .
__label__Neutral	amidst this covid 19 scare we are firmly committed to working until november but are highly discouraged to come for entire week of april even . hence it would be great if wework can waive the membership fee for april .

__label__Neutral	coronavirus business intensely .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus self isolation
__label__Neutral	wework like probably majority of your community members i am running small start - up office space rent wework . coronavirus has hit cashflow we are now in fight for survival of business . in meantime we are still paying rent for expensive office space that is empty as all my staff are working from home . one of my team had to go into our building briefly yesterday and said it was almost entirely empty so most occupiers are in position . please can you confirm what wework is to do to support your community of small business / start - up tenants through this unprecedented time ? not only are we as tenants all paying for service we ca n ' t use without support is very real risk could be no wework community very soon as businesses either go bust or chose to default on their rent . i ca n ' imagine it would be in wework ' s commercial to allow that to happen . i look forward to your response . ( i have already raised this matter with community team who did n ' t what to say )
__label__Negative	toilets are dirty most of time.office space is extremely dark ( when surrounding offices are not with their lights on it feels like it is night time ) way situation was handled with confirmed coronavirus ( covid-19 ) case was extremely unprofessional . whilst team tried to protect 1 member of entire wework they then put every other member at risk by not discolsing who they are . we were then not able to if we were in contact with them . i have younger children and elders with me as well as sick . had i known if was contact i would have needed to self isolate .
__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all regarding work from home given building aspects ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20 . separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of practitioners . we will be working hard in months beforehand to replace that revenue but short term we requires to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term successfully . we realize this is difficult begins for you also and organizations would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current month to month rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extending term to feb 2021 . look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides
__label__Negative	if wework is able to suspend our membership until covid-19 crisis passes we would like to stay . date we stopped using office due to government advisory to keep all non-essential work remote was 16 march so we request suspension from this date . if this is not possible unfortunately we have no choice but to cancel .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1. inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2. value vs quality offering is not compelling at martin place location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single person office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .
__label__Neutral	expensivestaffs ' response are poor and slowjudgment is extreme ? with measures against corona coffee virus tea water and even are longer no at offered wework shibuya scramble square however . is no explanation such as whether refund is during that period . it is necessary to stop offering things so far ? some people use office so please provide us least at . water ?

__label__Positive	 My experience This is just taking me out of town .
__label__Negative	i ' m member across various contracts and have been big fan of wework . you are completely neglecting biggest concern and humour that members have and it ’ s not doing you any favours at all . wework member are actually all on private slump channel talking and planning mass direct debit cancellation and termination . they are also talking to journalists too . this is because of fact you aren ’ t communicating on rent issue while they are struggling . walking around some of wework buildings i can see people experience already started moving out en mass too . what ’ s it to for wework to show it ’ s members some courtesy ? if you don ’ t want complete revolt from members i ’ d strongly suggest better response is send out today to show you rattling do care astir struggles they are all facing now .
__label__Negative	great but not so fun . corona virus and poor coffee quality .
__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear it back from building management . and yes it ' ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non - essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move - out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to tell me they could be considered an “ essential ” business … on related note which were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to there be further work done in coming days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current circumstance . lastly please keep me posted once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously stated i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent , in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of all our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay for back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all business in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality … many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and consistent effort . sending my best grant
__label__Negative	week we informed that at sonycenter has tested positive with covid i all community members with some questions and week after no at ! is important issue and we could n ' t count with them . so we decided to cancel our membership because wework is n ' as proactive as we

__label__Negative	i understand these are unprecedented times and is major impact on wework like companies renting space . that said approach here has shown zero leniencies . your costs are down as it relates to us not being able to send people to office and yet our costs have not been addressed . i ’ ll let samiksha continue to manage communication on our behalf . but as you raise this up to upper management please with approach here showing no compromise combined with lack of focus to right-size our space over last 6 months we 've lost confidence in wework . this leads me to tell you as of now without changes on behalf of our board we will 100 % not be renewing at end of our term . i hope this position changes as your stance does but please accept this as notice if not .

__label__Neutral	firstly we hope you and all your colleagues are well and properly during this time . at aaron basha it is our upmost priority to protect safety and well - being for all our employees . due to recent news and uncertainty surrounding covid - 19 we had made decision not heed warning of federal and local authorities and require our employees repeatedly conduct business at home until it is safe for everyone . we are also doing poorly since our employees rely on ny and nj mass transit to to work . i would like to request concessions wework is currently giving tenants if any . for this reason we are requesting concession and relief in our monthly rent . although wework is giving staff members options due to work since is adequate staffing we do not feel shared environment is inadequate .

__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to risk assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid-19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until later because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in my case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will mean i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee had severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to have all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no-reply @ wework.com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche.io develops cloud technology which enable people to work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need to be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p.s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid-19 by this visitor .

__label__Negative	i am glad to see more rational and carefully considered response from wework then message received last week regarding gas tower location . however i feel it is necessary to underscore how inappropriate and overreaching this office closure is . wework is without question absolutely not qualified to looks assessments on behalf of member companies and employees . wework does not maintain information necessary nor expertise to warrant blanket denial of access to member companies offices or employees belongings based suspicion of covid - 19 contamination or any other environmental risk for that matter . last week when i attempted to return to my office i was barred entry without recourse or timeline to when access would be restored . explanation for this i did not discover until deeper because it was disguised as typical community events posting which i generally ignore instead of direct email or phone call that i would have expected given such an extreme action . in questions case i lost access to vital medication that is difficult to replace . with luck i will finally be able to have scrip refilled today but that will kidding i have gone several days without ability to my medication . it could have been much worse ! just imagine if an employee caused severe allergy and needed to use an epipen they kept in their office ? only member companies and employees themselves can be expected to this information . i am almost definitely individual with highest exposure to wework gas tower environment between march 6th and march 18th . i therefore that value of being able to access my office to remove my medications and work computer far out way danger of few minutes or hours of additional exposure . yet i was not given opportunity to apply by greater situational awareness to minimize my own risk . obviously this is absolutely unacceptable but what is of even greater concern to me is that it is obvious . obviously you must not safety judgments for other people especially when you might reasonably expect not to sought all of necessary information or expertise to such call . i am shocked by these actions i am shocked by presumption of authority and i shocked by staggeringly poor communications surrounding this incident . below is notification i received . notice how reply address is “ no - reply @ wework . com ” notice how it repeatedly refers to building being closed which in fact was not . in addition to all of this reason i spent so many hours in my office since 6th ( and before ) is because my company avalanche . io develops cloud technology which enabled people indicated work remotely . my work has been seriously negatively impacted by this action right in time when i need requiring be doing more ! i am now no longer in california so i ’ m not even sure what to do about my office and equipment since i can ’ t imagine being back to deal with it in forceable future . i don ’ t what can even be done at this point but i felt it was vitally important to sure wework is put on notice and cautioned against handling future public safety issues this poorly . p . s . despite my extensive exposure to wework gas tower environment i have not yet developed any symptoms of infection . if exposure would have been on 6th then 14 days was friday 3 days ago i was not infected with covid - 19 by this visitor .

__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email . i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response ’ i ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast . it is unreasonable and insensitive for to wework continue to charge rent when have members been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co - working environments are unsafe very place to be at this time . additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership that benefits are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can very say confidently that majority wework of members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact . i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken of highly our experience to other business owners . sadly all positive of experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks . a few ago months i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably . i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency . you owe your members better than this .

__label__Negative	matters am exceedingly bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid - nineteen positive members situation was not tailored seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors examined taken responsible soli of shutting down and offering refunds to their instances ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i includes short - term financial reasoning behind detaining doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short - sighted .

__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because 's essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they 're taking hit . 's government order to stay inside so we ca n't use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st

__label__Negative	i we work has its own financial issues to contend with as that has played out in national media but i think some covid discount or refund for april when we are not allowed to use space would be nice gesture . we work was designed for start-up 's `` on edge '' and most of us have had to incur additional costs at home . i my org could really use extra funds . we have deferred any training income to our own partners to help them better serve their youth .

__label__Negative	only reason i gave lower marks for office is that i wish frosting on windows went up higher - too much visibility into our office which really can compromise confidential andity . some companies on our floor use shared office space for what are obviously lengthy internal meetings . i strongly feel that ending coffee shop and beer service and the honesty market is an overreaction to virus situation . cleanliness and common sense values should prevail . now we should have to go out to to convenience stores - and not coffee shops - wastes time and we interact with lot more sophisticated people .

__label__Neutral	dear wework team i am writing this email in light of recent worldwide events and circumstances surrounding covid-19 . i was hoping we would not have to resort to this but our company elite sales and services ( gvb ) has experienced an extreme reduction in workload and revenue as vast majority of our clients have been forced to shut down and freeze operations . given that state of california has implemented shelter in place policy and that we are not allowed to resume our regular operations at wework we would like to find way to relieve our financial burden while at same time maintain our responsibilities owed to wework . by means of this email we would like to ask that you postpone or reduce our rent due for months of april and may . we have been large customer of wework for some time and would greatly appreciate support in these trying times . it is of extreme importance to our company to maintain relationship we have built with wework and that we are able to continue our operations after our nation has surpassed this unexpected blow . we are hoping that we are able to come to an understanding where both elite sales and wework are able to find mutual grounds during these difficult times . please feel free to reach out to me directly . looking forward to your response .

__label__Positive	hannah and anna at 655 montgomery are also always being extremely more accommodating . it feels like maybe they really are now an extension of our team because they really really already are ! looking forward to heading out back in office post co -vid 19 quarantine .
__label__Negative	overall i love offering -- i have been fan for years . however i 'm not sure i agree with how wework has handled covid response for members .
__label__Negative	dear wework team we have been users of your product for some time and have loved experience . but in past few weeks our small business has taken major hit . if we can not cut costs we will have major chance of shutting down . wework represented for us 80 % of our costs as we just upgraded our plan and got closed office for 3. we tried to cancel but we are forced to pay two full months and we wo n't see our deposit only in few months . we are requesting that you consider refunding us for month of april and give us back our deposit . we have been loyal customers for while but we did not any use out of product for this period and if not for strictly cutting costs we may not be able to return to using your product in future . i hope you understand and ’ s something you can do to help our situation .
__label__Negative	i ’ m not happy w coronavirus protocols . you basically shut down your operations pulled all your staff yet told us we can keep coming to work even though you that we are mandated to stay home during this crisis . in your carelessness you may have even caused more contamination all in service of still collecting rent.i noticed that on very first day of this month you pulled my rent out of my bank acct . we are small business and i really think your actions are irresponsible and not community-oriented.since you claim to be community focused this behavior doesn ’ t ring true.i suggest given we can ’ t use our offices this month that you should discount rent by at least 50 % or waive it completely

__label__Negative	reduced one person office to hot desk and working from home due to national and portions of nevada laws restricting use due to emergency . i feel wework should have immediately allowed this reduction and not forced me down pay thru may because you see it as an effort to support wework w / o just leaving - i thought your goal was to grow start ups and small businesses . i am disadvantaged wosb who believes in and supports wework under las vegas while staying next to no extra burden without their overhead . )
__label__Positive	akin ofova later stage startup in insurt andech space has also been at labs london since it ' s opened . due to covid they ca n ' t make use of their 9 desks but their instead of entirely not moving out ceo wants them to always keep one desk ( on full price price ) to stay part of labs community in these challenging circumstances . founder / ceo henri says ` ` this is not decision and we lightly

__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april tuned covid - 19 situation ayrton hough methods language that our decision to operate from home supplies an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and clusters . our decision to work from home is certainly not an ` ` internal precautionary measure ' ' but following government advice in order to save lives . any idea we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it ' s this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid - 19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason constitutes to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just suggest that but do n ' t say we ' re being cautious contracted topical crisis .

__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have committed to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework ' s current statement of policy . california is under state - wide order from the governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid - 19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate . . . and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter / hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this again for ` ` essential businesses ' ' than stipulation that only businesses that are ` ` essential ' ' - i . e . ` ` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state ' ' , are only ones allowed in wework . anything going beyond that can only generally be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over risk public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh to judge . i truly do hope wework leadership actually often reads this .

__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides
__label__Negative	whilst i have been completely satisfied with wework until now i do n't think that wework are handling covid situation particularly well - i have been waiting for weeks to hear whether or not you will be doing anything to support your members who are individual/small businesses and have heard nothing . other places/services i subscribe to in my life have communicated clearly offered frozen memberships etc yet wework still seems happy to monthly payments for desk i ca n't sit at . it 's unlikely that i will still be wework member this time next month - and for company size of wework i would have expected better crisis management .

__label__Negative	your company does not value trust position in you by companies that have chosen to do business with you . in desperate times you have chosen profits over partnership . you squeezed us for every last penny you could from us . during covid - 19 pandemic you have not conceded any of your rank fees and in fact suggested that we expose our stave to virus by sending them to bureau because wework was ` ` obligated to continue providing access to these locations under this pretense ' ' pretense be that legal age of their location remained open because you have supposed essential workers using their space . given this suggestion to us i doubt that is true . since you want to squeeze us for few nickels now you ' ve lost potential for any future dollars with us .

__label__Negative	wework should not be open . people keep testing positive for coronavirus . it 's irresponsible to keep it open .
__label__Negative	1. i think that service quality has gone down bit since reorganization of corporate . we always experienced lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated.2 . has been no effort to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this covid crisis.3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4. part of wework 's value prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited to 9am to 6pm this does n't reflect way business is done in nyc . 5. our front desk does n't open until 9am . in normal nyc building desks are staffed 24/7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .
__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .
__label__Negative	once virus scare subsides am looking to be back in this space .

__label__Negative	my experience with wework has been very good . my frustration is regarding wework ' s covid policy . due to legislations during our state we have not used our space for weeks and likely wo n ' t for next month . these are extraordinary circumstances canadians amounts would have expected more cooperation requests tenants to work onto pausing agreements while we are enduring such financial distress . delegations was told that bureau remains open so we will be argued .

__label__Neutral	( ... ) i 'm writing because given our similar businesses i 'm hoping you can help me . our industries are getting rocked right now and we 're reaching out to all of our partners ( i 'm guessing wework is doing same ) to ask for help.with our workspace landscape dramatically shifted for unforeseen future i am hoping we can some rent relief . our plan with new space was to grow rapidly our team month over month and fill space . ironically we had less than 2 weeks in new space before we had to send out notices that employee 's needed to begin working from home for their health and safety.like us wework has dramatically scaled back office operations to barebones crew and most of services that wework amazing will be paused until we back to sense of normalcy.please let me how you can help . we love having you as partner and hope that together we can through these crazy times together.sincerely
__label__Neutral	i just received this update however it does not outline wework 's policies for non-essential business . due to extreme uncertainty of what is to come next and how long will government shutdown last until i would strongly request wework management to not charge non-essential business until is further clarity on situation . if possible please provide us with confirmation before end of this month on whether or not wework will continue to charge non-essential businesses for unused space . i hope during this time of uncertainty we can continue to build more meaningful relationship with wework . look forward to hearing from you asap .
__label__Positive	i will come back after coronavirus stopped
__label__Negative	we work couldve been less uninstructive and helpful during lock down stages of covid . we work didnt specify on what will happen with monthly payments once lock down was announced as we work is not open during this period . i would like to still be part of we work and for you to not charge me during this period of lockdown
__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have come to say that some of your employees that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . all your business is non - essential and so are companies who call wework home . but to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid - 19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your companies and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just cause you had terrible ceo and now wework is dead financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well - being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and safety being at bottom of your priority list . at long last you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .
__label__Negative	it is very regrettable that an option to pause or offer reduced rent was not made available during covid-19 crisis . if this was an option i would have stayed . however is so much uncertainty regarding covid that i had no choice but to cancel my membership until i when covid crisis will end .

__label__Negative	 you should explore being able to allow person to retain the fee space in return for keeping service ret ainer ( just stopping monthly payments ) or keeping the monthly fee cap to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i . e . cov DoS ) . i think it would show some loyalty to your service which I would return to you , only alternative i see is to terminate my membership .

__label__Neutral	original request - pre - shelter in place - as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4 . 098 and 4 . 102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4 . 1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ am sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv - 19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise how this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4 . 1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit shared space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease . could we have discussion about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more cramped spaces ) ? modified request - post - shelter in place - i ’ m aware of recent announcement in new york from governor cu boulder which has ordered all non - essential workers to begin travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as this means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some type of rebate to reflect self - usage .

__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Positive	to all of us in community who are into buildings and maybe even questioning `` why '' at this point ... .had really amazing interaction yesterday worth sharing.i went in on my rotational shift yesterday and collected mail to distribute . i noticed one of pieces of mail was obviously check for our member company took picture of letter and sent it to member.he texted me back and was beyond grateful . inside of this envelope was large check from customer that he needed to continue paying his staff through this crisis and was n't sure that it would ever come.these are tough times but it 's good to that executing on even most basic things we provide really matter right now . stay strong out community team ! ! if you have n't heard it today ... thank you for what you 're all doing !
__label__Negative	i had pretty decent experience with wework up until this point . i informed wework team morning of april 1st that i would not be renewing my contract ; this would be my last month . they indicated since my request did n ' t come in on march 31st ( more than 10 hours before ) . i had to pay for an extra month . this is really unprofessional especially given covid - 19 situation . i refuse n ' t been able to use my office since march 13th .

__label__Negative	i 've worked in weworks before ( times square and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches have food/crumbs/stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events /popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else 's lunch crumbs or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .
__label__Neutral	we are currently tenants in 880 3rd avenue . as you can imagine our business is being heavily impacted by current unprecedented situation . therefore we need to freeze/ reduce our rent obligations immediately . who can we speak to ? based on phone call renovata does executive search// face to face interviews and companies are placing these hiring processes on hold// revenue streams are frozen
__label__Positive	going for great help - everyone is lame .
__label__Negative	i did ask for quad for two of uranium merely pricing be to a fault high . i though given availabilities in my department only would give birth be more wiggle room pricing . subsequently with virus its just not economically feasibile anymore .
__label__Neutral	this company represents parents of students with special needs protected under individuals with disabilities education act . many of families ( clients of member ) are low income families who are n't able to pay firm at this time which has lead to limited cash flow . they could use reduced rent so firm can stay running and pay employees .

__label__Neutral	as small nonprofit we 're looking to cut costs where we can and i wanted to see if we 're able to reduce our rent or what it would look like to cancel.some quick notes about org./our team adventure project 501c3our mission is to lift people out of extreme poverty through job creation ( currently our programs are in africa ) after cutting salaries and running our financial projections since covid- 19 we 're looking at 3 - 6 months left of operational runway . this is just for us to survive- we also owe close to $ 200k to our program partners by end of 2020.our founder is 8 months pregnant and has dengue fever ( something that compromises your immune system and stays with you always after getting it ) so we 're obviously not using office currently.notes about our lease agreement ( attached ) rent = $ 3910/monthwe rent 10 person officeour lease is from august 1 2018 for 36 months.most of our biggest donors are unable to support us at this time because they are having their own financial concerns . we 're applying to government grants and are keeping close eye on other options as they roll out but rent continues to be one of our largest expenses .
__label__Positive	thanked you for everything ! tammy really wished i could have stayed . however current covid [MASK] situation will likely keep me in bay for months permitting .
__label__Neutral	because of virus situation we all would work on at our home for while waiting until situation gets better .
__label__Neutral	in light of fact that wework sf is now shut down for at least three weeks and we ca n't go to office space we are paying for i 'm wondering if you 'd be open to offering us some kind of break on rent ? julie and i would be so grateful if you 'd consider making something work .
__label__Negative	 it has a very good experience . everybody is so nice helpful and welcoming . transition has been really fast . we did notice though that are no toilet seat covers in restrooms and were disappointed particularly in with lack of virus . other that all our employees really like working here . thanks to great team for serving everybody .
__label__Negative	 How to freeze my property during cov id can crisis
__label__Negative	we are moving which i informed wework of . but for whole month of april and half of march i could n't use office anyway because of covid . why you did did n't officially shut it down under registration i have no idea . you are only allowed to use office for totally essential work you ca n't do from home so you ww users ca n't use their office .

__label__Negative	Should wework be issuing refunds during where months we are n ' t allowed even to in work buildings to due this coronavirus . been has extremely disappointing .
__label__Negative	due to recent shut down in ny due to covid-19 of non-essential business it is presumed that wework will be pro-rating our monthly rent for month of march and until such time as we have clearance that we are permitted to return to office from federal state or local government . kindly inform us of what if any paperwork is necessary to be completed to receive proper credit . if any paperwork is needed kindly forward it to my attention . if direct credit will be applied please inform accordingly . thanking you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter . i ’ d like to discuss my with someone . state of ca and city of los angeles have mandated that we stay home and not venture out into public spaces and workplace . other companies we have relationships and monthly contracts with have suspended march and april rent payments and they will re-access for may . we tried to go to our office on saturday and parking garage was closed . we were forced to park on street and subsequently received parking ticket . once inside building bathrooms had not been cleaned and floors were dirty . our facility is not being cleaned and measures are not being taken to clean and sanitize any more than they have in past . mandate from federal government is to stay away from public spaces and we feel that wework isn ’ t designed to support this mandate . i ’ d like to talk to someone about getting credit for march as well as not paying for future months until this virus and global pandemic is behind us . furthermore financial hardship of having this payment each month that we can ’ t work out of is to be painful . please advise .

__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment . as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary disturbances . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in shortfalls or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance . the declarations of states of emergency by state of new months and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date followed it appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter - on - place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and licensees eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are equally suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework during agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon because we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am benevolent to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020 . please confirm . thank you . best katie
__label__Negative	as market has resulted in lot of companies having work from home policies due to corona virus we would have liked to stay but at reduced rate . as this was not possible we are moving to another space unfortunately .
__label__Negative	too slow to respond to covid . my business had to exit 3+ weeks ago due to failure to implement correct vetting of visitors . really really poor response in allowing all and sundry to visit with no regard for wellbeing of clients within your premises . like ( d ) facilities otherwise pre worldwide pandemic that you were woefully slow responding to so did n't rate any lower .
__label__Positive	loved community facilities and wework at team 161 castlereagh - hope really to be able to covid return after - situation is 19 over .
__label__Negative	although i appreciate this may not be your area we are tenant in 10 york road and as of today we have not had any meaningful contact from anyone at wework to how company will be passing on governments assistance to its tenants . given enormity of issue i strongly recommend wework action to help sme 's & freelancers or you wo n't have any companies left to occupy offices on their return .

__label__Negative	we would like to express our sincere reductions to chris jess katie becca and enrico during making us feel extremely welcome since day 1 and invites creating such strong community of co - workers within edinburgh office . they are excellent ambassadors of wework brand and have made our time easy and enjoyable . we would loved to have stayed longer but this is unfortunately not possible due to significant impacts of covid - 19 pandemic on uk economy including our business . we wish you you all well for future canadians we hope pointed constitute back in some form at later date perhaps in hotdesking capacity

__label__Negative	in dark of current health crisis i have decided not to renew my office lease and have removed all items from my space . march payment has already been processed and will be last month with wework until covid - 19 virus has been blunted . please let me what further actions are obviate as i do not wish to move forward with three month additional term . fortunately no contract was ever signed on my end .
__label__Negative	you should be freezing accounts for those who are mandated to be quarantined and not those essential workers .
__label__Neutral	i am trying to access recent membership agreement to review it but it keeps taking me to member network and only thing i can find in my settings is billing info . what i 'd like to what is cancellation policy of this membership and what fees would i incur or money i would lose/owe should i cancel my membership ? i am trying to necessary arrangements for my business and weighing all of my business expenses at moment in light of what is on . '' member also mentioned in person how he has been wework member for 5 years has small business that is being impacted and just started his commitment in march .

__label__Neutral	member was terminated from his contract so he now has no income and no need for space . has already vacated and is requesting move out for 3/31/2020
__label__Negative	it is shame to have to leave without intention of returning . by better helping us manage short term impacts of covid 19 on our business with view to long-term office space partnership with wework we would have liked to come back and perhaps stood better chance of navigating this period with support . unfortunately that was n't possible .
__label__Neutral	due to covid - page 19 issue our company nasu are facing really hard time . we have to cut our expenses to avoid bankrupt due to significant drop in revenue revenue . lots of our partners are closed including ski resorts executives and other event coordinators . i have to hard decision on which nasu may move out of office . before i decision may i consider what loss may be caused by breaking lease ? i currently are 1 . 5 thousand of basic rent as retainer fee will not not go back . is any other fees may apply ? i love wework and community and really enjoy days work together with you .
__label__Positive	i will definitely return once covid thing gets over .
__label__Positive	i had a great experience at town square we work and loved it . while due directly to covid - 19 i first was hard n ' t comfortable using shared works forpace . and then we then had to shut down our start up due to covid - 19 so we can not pay for space . well i would definitely use it again in future under better improved economic conditions and health circumstances .

__label__Neutral	i love community team and i love working out of wework but i sure do n't like covid -19 just to ensure an extended precautionary measure i have decided to work from home !
__label__Negative	lack of materials resources . technology does not work . irresponsible management of covid19 crisis
__label__Neutral	korea is wework limiting people with global pass . basically they do not due allow to covid - 19 . but at working global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i ' m korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between hours those . also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work . the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels the . pros of working wework at is condition of and desks is interior good . also drinks and are ammedities good . lastly employees at wework do n ' t do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being out sorted .
__label__Negative	 this e mail came from my York office . are you all still listening of what is on TV NY ? ? ?

__label__Neutral	i despair you and yours differ safe and well . thanks for message . lack you seen messages i ’ ve been sharing with my building manager at international house ? these are regarding fact that due to government guidelines we can ’ t use our office yet you are still charging us full rent and not prepared to discuss how this will affect my business my staff and all our livelihoods . please can we speak directly as this would be my preference rather than involving wework network my trade body legal team and arnold ash legal team .
__label__Neutral	i am sure we will not only to ask but we wanted to see if wework was offering any concessions or rent abatement in month of april . as i can see our business clients are suffering ( like all industries ) and we ’ re being asked to drastically cut fees for next month ; as mid - year we work member we wanted we discuss if discount might be available via next month . i this isn ’ t necessarily your problem but wanted to see if you might be able to discuss on our behalf with sales team . appreciate consideration .

__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .
__label__Neutral	holly and ethan are great - but they ' n ' me answer one of my questions about staff appointments during school . because is already taking place from wework central . . .
__label__Negative	wework concept is amazing i think were some physical and management issues with no.1 spinningfields being new building and wework has been through some changes corporately since i invested two years ago which has affected service negatively . overall i 'm satisfied but with reduced level of service it 's become too expensive alongside market changes ( brexit / general election / coronavirus ) which have negatively impacted my business . i 've also encountered two members at wework that lack integrity and i do n't wish to be associated with them . my business is 12 years old and i work with public sector agencies and reception staff did n't treat me / my clients with respect i feel we deserve ( they were n't as professional with wework members / visitors as their corporate occupiers in my view ) .

__label__Negative	since from working home due to covid i can see how much better it is . i need to one or confidential two calls day and absolutely can ’ t do that from wework ! surely sound proof phone booths is basic requirement for office space . also i gave up tryjng to printing to work . helpdesk tried to help but it got never resolved and ’ shouldn t have been tricky . sign up process was nightmare with multiple emails payment demanding which turned out ( when questioned i them ) to be wrong . overall very unprofessional experience . even to trying fill out this form took 4 browsers across two devices to eventually find ststem on wgich form this worked

__label__Neutral	 He had terminated before his contract so he now has extra income and no need for it . has already vacated and is requesting move together with replacement
__label__Negative	i have not enjoyed all my experience at wework until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . unfortunately for me this option to be able to hot desk clients in other retail locations was one of main job perks and something i will miss . for me crisis response and messaging and we arework ’ ' s willingness not to expose its members and front - line employees to risk were deal breakers .

__label__Neutral	fact besides i that n ca ' t use office now my revenue was hurt also covid by .
__label__Negative	you should be closing your offices because of covid-19 and refunding companies their rent for time that they can not be utilizing facility . big coworking spaces are not safe place to be thus you are disregarding health and safety of tenants and your employees .
__label__Negative	no relief on any request made due to hardship or during due to virus . also putting greed above people 's safety by keeping buildings open . i blame this entirely on finance not excellent staff .

__label__Neutral	thanks for getting back to me . i we are signed on through august but our company has been hit very hard by current circumstances . i was hoping could be some flexibility on our membership terms . it will be struggle for us to continue with our current agreement.can you let me if wework is able to any accomodations ?
__label__Neutral	i am under mandatory quarantine and deemed unessential per order of local new york government . see below . we are scheduled to move out in april but will need to cancel membership and expedite move out .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1 . inability to utilise space again value with money . teh covid units which are being indicated for authorities will last for an extended time . 2 . value vs quality offering is not compelling in martin house location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single office positions which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural illumination . acoustics is also poor at k place location .
__label__Neutral	original request- pre-shelter in place- as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4.098 and 4.102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4.1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ m sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv-19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise that this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4.1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease.could we have conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request- post- shelter in place- i ’ m aware of recent announcement in new york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non-essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non-usage .
__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming charge ” and am truly disgusted nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job. ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors may continue to go to their jobs.weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential business . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has been shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive orders we can through this and be back to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making choices in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well being during this horrific pandemic .

__label__Negative	thank you for message . could someone from wework please cancel my commons membership ? thanks again .
__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014 three months . ago i would have given wework 9 . but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems largely due to gross mismanagement . also we have asking been for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly they since were ` ` upgraded ' ' 1 - years ago 2 . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca ' n t believe what you say .

__label__Neutral	dear blair and molly as we ` ve all been following covid-19 pandemic is causing many disruptions in retail space . to greater good of us all stores have been closed and people have been stranded at home without clue of what future holds and when this nightmare will end.unfortunately this has great impact in our business as fashion retail is very cash intensive business . and for small brand new growing brand like ours impacts are even greater and we need to quick actions to survive.we are confident this will end and everything will be back to normal and we will continue growing path we were so excitingly building . we just don ` t when and it doesn ’ t look like it will be soon.therefore we will need to terminate agreement we have in place with you as we are no longer able to honor terms we have right now.please let us how to proceed . we will be moved out by march 31st.thanks fabio

__label__Negative	everything about how wework has handled this covid situation has been poorly managed . in weeks lead up to the outbreak / closure was not single hand - sanitizer jar to be found in our offices . bathroom was routinely out of papertowels . one of room in women ' s restroom has n ' t worked since we moved in late last year . you ' ve continued to your staff go in when things were getting worse . i had conversation with one of cleaning folks and they were genuinely afraid for their health but did n ' t want to quit their job . now we are banned from working and you is trying to upsell us into 12 month lease ? and it ' s taking you weeks to figure out how to handle our situation ( and i ' m sure everyone else is in same boat here ) . meanwhile answer should seem pretty clear . other co - working spaces have paused agreements but we ' re still trying - squeeze out any last dollar in last ditched effort of self - preservation . while we loved staff at our location and loved product in good times mismanagement during bad times are enough to tell us to look elsewhere when this is all stabilized .

__label__Negative	i ' ve worked in weworks before ( times squarely and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always unsportsmanlike . tables and bench have food / crumbs / stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events / popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else ' s lunch skunk or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .

__label__Neutral	i return once covid - 19 down .
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .

__label__Negative	service is poor . even before covid responses to service issues were for lack of better phrase something that 5 year old would be better at . staff seemed incompetent and unable to understand basic office concepts . retrieving mail and packages was always hassle ( they could never find things ) . sound proofing is nonexistent - zero privacy for business matters especially in conference rooms . also during covid -- zero offers for even reduced rent etc . since we can not use building or operate businesses . as soon as this crisis is over i will be cancelling my contract and finding new space .
__label__Neutral	i am trying to sites recent membership agreement to measuring it but it keeps taking me to member network and only thing i can discover in my settings is billing info . what i ' d like to what is cancellation policy of this membership and what fees would i incur or money i would lose / owe should i cancel my membership ? indicators am trying to necessary arrangements for my business and forcing all of my business expenses at moment under light of what is on .

__label__Neutral	nothing . covid
__label__Neutral	i am sure we will not only to ask but we wanted to see if wework was offering any concessions or rent abatement for month of april . as you can imagine our travel clients are suffering ( like all industries ) and we ’ re being asked to drastically cut fees for next month ; as five-year wework member we wanted to see if discount might be available for next month . i this isn ’ t necessarily your area but wanted to see if you might be able to discuss on our behalf with sales team . appreciate consideration .

__label__Positive	i wanted to inquire about virtual tours of sf wework spaces . 50 - 100p end in november
__label__Negative	" in normal circumstances my rating might be higher but i think you ' ve chosen seriously odd time to ask for your feedback given we ca n ' t work in either your london offices anymore during lockdown unless we specifically want to increase in our chances of getting coronavirus . i also think you should give businesses discount while they do ca n ' t use your services .

__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear back from building management . and yes it ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non-essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move-out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to me they could be considered an “ essential ” business…on related note were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to be further work done in coming days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current circumstance.lastly please keep me posted once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously stated i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality…many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and effort.sending my best grant
