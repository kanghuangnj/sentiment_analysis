__label__Negative	response to covid is appalling
__label__Negative	were certain promises made at time of contract execution that were not fulfilled . i wish these items would have been included in contract . is lack of parking . 0 privacy and you can hear everything in office next to you . conference room phones do not work . acoustics in conference rooms are horrible . cleaning amid coronavirus was very lack luster . utensils are hand washed and then laid directly on table . our office area is not vacuumed . it is very frustrating to arrive at work at 7 am and not have access to coffee until cleaning crew arrives at 8:30 or 9:00the first group of employees at wework were very difficult to work with ( adriene matsudaira ) team that now manages our site are great to work with lindsey palmer alexis hesse .
__label__Negative	i just do n't feel safe to go back to wework during coronavirus outbreak .
__label__Neutral	i will be back after covid ! !
__label__Neutral	unfortunate timing with coronavirus ; we enjoyed short period we were at wework .
__label__Negative	i am disgusted that you are keeping facility open and telling your members to come in come in still use your cards ... we have new wifi system ... this is unethical . not only can you not provide reception services but you are deliberately adding to spread of covid19 .
__label__Positive	i wanted to inquire about virtual tours of sf wework spaces . 50-100p starting in november
__label__Negative	nope . one thing that concerns me is mainly with situation of illnesses occurring ( i.e. covid-19 ) how is cleanliness of common area-shared cups/mugs ? sometimes dishwasher may not clean cups too well ... so just this concern of shared items/appliances .
__label__Negative	you should be closing your offices because of covid-19 and refunding companies their rent for time that they can not be utilizing facility . big coworking spaces are not safe place to be thus you are disregarding health and safety of tenants and your employees .
__label__Neutral	home office due to covid-19
__label__Neutral	there- form did n't work last night . please advise ... we are at 11 park place fl 4 in manhattan . maypole environmental inspections .
__label__Positive	home for now . will definitely become member again once virus runs its course .
__label__Negative	wework should be issuing refunds during months where we are n't even allowed to work in buildings due to coronavirus . this has been extremely disappointing .
__label__Neutral	wfh until covid - 19 is better
__label__Neutral	are we to be allowed to cancel our memberships if this is prolonged ?
__label__Negative	coronavirus has showed wfh is better
__label__Neutral	thanks for this email i how busy you are so thank you for taking time to send this through we have been chatting with our floor manager at 199 bishopsgate regarding our membership to be paused and i thought it would be best to escalate this to senior management like yourselves . please see our formal request to wework directors for our contract to be suspended until end of may.our main business activity relies primarily on tourism and event marketing and due to current corona virus crisis we 've lost over 90 % of our contracts and that has seriously affected our immediate cash flow as well as our short term prospects.we can not claim any business rates relief because as wework tenants we don ’ t pay any . we may be able to apply for govt grant announced recently but even if successful we don ’ t when those funds would reach us.i believe we have been good tenants of wework paying our rent even when we have had difficulties but corona crisis has devastated everyone including us . as result we can not afford to pay rent and humbly request that you pause our contract until end of may.if we ca n't operate then we won ’ t be able to pay anyone and will have to cease trading which is not good all round.we do not intend on terminating our contract as we hope we 're able to back to some normality once lockdown is lifted however for foreseeable future we are in very tough financial position as small business and are please requesting wework directors to help us come to solution that enables us to try and carry on business where possible ? please can you help our business to stay afloat ?
__label__Neutral	we would like to spend zero in april and onward while offices are closed or we are not working at office . after we return to work/offices are open for normal operations we are prepared to pay rent you we have now . we are prepared to commit to 3 or 6 months .
__label__Negative	not happy with your handling covid-19 situation
__label__Neutral	we work . we 're client iwth 30+ seats in wework at 114 william street in melbourne australia . we have heard that one of your premises in spencer street has been locked out due to covid-19 . we are concerned about risk to our business if facility in william street is locked out at commencement of business tomorrow . we urgently require response .
__label__Neutral	member would like to terminate their agreement in new york and denver with immediate effect . due to nature of their business ( mobile ticketing services for public transport ) and impact of coronavirus they will not be able to afford to remain .
__label__Neutral	covid-19
__label__Negative	when we asked if we could end contract at end of march instead of april given covid-19 situation ayrton hough used language that our decision to work from home is an `` internal precautionary measure '' . government advice is to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings . our decision to work from home is certainly not an `` internal precautionary measure '' but following government advice in order to save lives . any suggestion we are being overcautious by not using wework is absurd and it 's this sort of langauge opinion and behaviour why covid-19 continues to spread in australia . if real reason is to enforce contractual obligations to keep our money just say that but do n't say we 're being cautious given current crisis .
__label__Neutral	you had covid19 case in march .
__label__Neutral	dear blair and molly as we ` ve all been following covid-19 pandemic is causing many disruptions in retail space . to greater good of us all stores have been closed and people have been stranded at home without clue of what future holds and when this nightmare will end.unfortunately this has great impact in our business as fashion retail is very cash intensive business . and for small brand new growing brand like ours impacts are even greater and we need to quick actions to survive.we are confident this will end and everything will be back to normal and we will continue growing path we were so excitingly building . we just don ` t when and it doesn ’ t look like it will be soon.therefore we will need to terminate agreement we have in place with you as we are no longer able to honor terms we have right now.please let us how to proceed . we will be moved out by march 31st.thanks fabio
__label__Neutral	wework needs to some changes to its policies during covid-19 months for rent relief for its customers who are following local government guidelines to stay at home .
__label__Negative	1 ) me gustaría saber protocolos de evacuación cuando hay emergencias . 2 ) estamos en un edificio donde es muy complicado entrar y salir ( tiempo 2 elevadores muy tardados etc. ) . 3 ) los estacionamientos están muy sucios y los señalamientos no son suficientes o están incorrectos . 4 ) con la contingencia del coronavirus no hay antibacterial en las áreas comunes como en otros edificios/empresas .
__label__Neutral	i have already given few suggestions by and large staff is extremely helpful and friendly . i missed lot of work days in march 2020 due to covid it would be helpful if you could advise on that .
__label__Neutral	while i am not currently utilizing empire office i am allowed to supersede nys executive order stated based on this federal directive . additional documentation can be provided if necessary . https //www.cisa.gov/communications-sector while i do not intend to utilize empire office i am also not relinquishing option to do so for remainder of our contracted rental period . thank you for notification .
__label__Neutral	we regret to inform you that due to covid-19 we will be canceling our wework office agreement and member for arrive outdoors . in this time of national emergency and pandemic affecting los angeles we are heading call of president cdc governor newsome and los angeles mayor garcetti not to participate in group settings of over 10 people for safety of our staff and for safety of larger community . our office team will be working from home for foreseeable future during national emergency . it sealed decision for us today when governor newsome announced that we should prepare for schools to be closed for months . we are requesting that due to these extenuating circumstances we have tomorrow 3/18/20 be our last day of our lease agreement . and that we pro-rate cost of our lease for this month .
__label__Negative	though looking good facilities in fact are not user-friendly slippy floor too bright rooms if they are facing south no control on temperature no drinks/snacks served ( due to covid-19 ) no vending machine . it might be good to stop by and host guests occasionally but it is difficult and inefficient to work in here anticipating proper function .

__label__Positive	gener8 5-person startup has decided to keep one fully paid desk at labs despite needing to cancel their other 4 while they ca n't access office due to covid-19 . in words of founder sam `` we ’ ll keep this so that we can still stay close to you and be part of labs community .
__label__Positive	prior to covid19 epidemic we work seems to be ideal with working space and facilities to match with modern environment . with fear of disease spreading now i believe wework would implement up to date cautious practices such as social distancing in elevator and everywhere frequent cleaning and hygiene etc . i wish all best .
__label__Neutral	it depends on situation with covid . i can not afford to pay an office if i am not making any income .
__label__Negative	no relief on any request made due to hardship or during due to virus . also putting greed above people 's safety by keeping buildings open . i blame this entirely on finance not excellent staff .
__label__Negative	due to corona virus situation i dont feel safe being in wework space . i would like to ask for refund for rest of month .
__label__Negative	service and all offering have been cut apart from our rent . communication has been poor too . keep making cutbacks hoping people wo n't notice . most perks gone and no mention of covid 19 or impacts to its tenants !
__label__Positive	whole crew at wework 27-01 queens plaza n long island city ny 11101 is incredible . i miss on daily basis and i hope to be back after covid-19 .
__label__Negative	main 2 reasons driving my departure are 1. inability to utilise space again value for money given teh covid restrictions which are being indicated by authorities will last for an extended time . 2. value vs quality offering is not compelling at martin place location . essentially i would like an office by window with high levels of natural light but those type of offices are all larger than single person office which i need . single offices are close core with limited natural light . acoustics is also poor at martin place location .
__label__Neutral	please inform me once covid 19 situation has settled and wework is operating back to normal .
__label__Neutral	i have enjoyed my brief time at wework . i have couple of months of travel ( assuming that corana virus does n't mess it up ) in april and may . i will probably be back looking for one-person office in june . thanks .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 reduced wework activities.chances to meet and collaborate with other comapnies are really difficult now.on other hand i really appriciate that wework staffs are keeping rooms clean .
__label__Neutral	event staffing solutions is an event based business . due to new york state and city mandates banning large gatherings/groups cash flow of this business has come to stop . they are committed through november 30 2020. they are asking to freeze their as they are not to be able to afford upcoming rents for next 3 months . they want to finish out their commitment to wework and have no issues doing so . they simply can not afford to in moment .
__label__Neutral	covid-19 virus has deeply effected our company- by at least 50 % for this year i 'm expecting .
__label__Positive	hope you are safe team – you ’ re doing great job .
__label__Neutral	i hope all is well and you are staying safe and healthy.given significant increase in spread of corona virus across us and local government advice we have instructed all our workers to work from home as of march 16 2020.operationally our staff is able to work from home given phaidon ’ s heavy investment in technology in 2019 where we moved entire business to cloud.we are asking all landlords where we are not using their offices to allow us to defer rent for this period to end of lease term . our best estimate is this is likely to be for three ( 3 ) months.thank you for your assistance at this challenging time.respectfully
__label__Negative	- catastrophic customer service ( ramin in frankfurt ) - unreliability of services such as printer coffee machine water dispenser etc.- limited accessibility of post ( 2 hours day and they ( ramin ) give you shit for asking outside of those two hours while i have read that wework is considered to be an `` essential '' postal company in covid times to be open ) - inacceptable hygene measures ( how many hands have touched ice in ice machine ? ? seriously ? ! ) - feedback implementation based on kpis ( # closed tickets ) only rather than actually solving issues
__label__Neutral	will be back to we work once covid - 19 settles down .
__label__Negative	thank you for message . could someone from wework please cancel my commons membership ? thanks again .
__label__Negative	i am extremely bothered by wework ’ s response to pandemic . even after multiple locations have found to have covid-19 positive members situation was not taken seriously . all it takes is one contaminated surface for virus to spread and people can be carriers without showing any symptoms and infect vulnerable people to whom virus have proven fatal . i also worry about safety of cleaning crew who i ’ m unsure is provided with protective gear especially at locations that had been exposed . most of wework ’ s competitors have taken responsible step of shutting down and offering refunds to their members ( who are unable or unwilling to use space during pandemic ) . while i understand short-term financial reasoning behind keeping doors open fact remains that it is irresponsible and extremely short-sighted .
__label__Neutral	conversation was over phone but she needs to conserve cash as her business is taking hard hit due to client retainers dropping on her side and is scrambling to cut costs . she states that she wants to be member with us after this season but she has to something lowered for time being or move-out .
__label__Negative	thanks for great facility and professional staff . hope to back onboard once covid19 settles ... whenever that happens .
__label__Neutral	we just submitted request as create restaurants ny is deemed essential under relevant regulations and guidelines and following is what we received after submitting . submission was made through `` contact support '' as that is where we were directed to once we clicked on `` essential business '' .
__label__Neutral	i want to cancel my membership or downgrade to one person office as my employees wo n't come in to office given coronavirus pandemic .
__label__Neutral	i will be working from home till time situation around covid-19 is under control . mostly through month of april
__label__Neutral	thanks for getting back to me . i we are signed on through august but our company has been hit very hard by current circumstances . i was hoping could be some flexibility on our membership terms . it will be struggle for us to continue with our current agreement.can you let me if wework is able to any accomodations ?
__label__Negative	i appreciate your help and i understand this is coming from you but leadership team at we work has just pulled terrible move for its tenants . claim that they need to stay open because 's essential business operating out of them is absolutely ridiculous . essential businesses up 2 % of we works tenants and they can provide them access only cards . this is wework not wanting to do right thing for its tenants because it means they 're taking hit . 's government order to stay inside so we ca n't use space even if we wanted to so for wework not to provide relief is absurd . if you guys arent opening to suspending our lease then we need to cancel it as of april 1st
__label__Neutral	this company represents parents of students with special needs protected under individuals with disabilities education act . many of families ( clients of member ) are low income families who are n't able to pay firm at this time which has lead to limited cash flow . they could use reduced rent so firm can stay running and pay employees .
__label__Positive	great experience covid19 is just taking me out of town .
__label__Negative	it ’ s actually ironic that you talk about “ covid support ” while wework wants to charge us for not returning keys since our contract with you is expiring today.we ’ ve been asked to and i am quoting “ go to postal offices ” otherwise we will be charged hundred pounds per key.this is really shameful just hope you are aware of that .
__label__Negative	i understand these are unprecedented times and is major impact on wework like companies renting space . that said approach here has shown zero leniencies . your costs are down as it relates to us not being able to send people to office and yet our costs have not been addressed . i ’ ll let samiksha continue to manage communication on our behalf . but as you raise this up to upper management please with approach here showing no compromise combined with lack of focus to right-size our space over last 6 months we 've lost confidence in wework . this leads me to tell you as of now without changes on behalf of our board we will 100 % not be renewing at end of our term . i hope this position changes as your stance does but please accept this as notice if not .
__label__Neutral	please detail my companies financial exposure if we choose to move out on thursday 4/30 . have let them what they 'd be responsible for per ma
__label__Positive	this survey has bugs on number/range selector questions and questions are likely to produce negative/skewed results . we 're very thankful to have had caring community team and we look forward to rejoining community once covid-19 circumstances allow us to all work safely .
__label__Neutral	it 's first time i 've worked in wework and it was brilliant . biscuits galore tea coffee and events ! staff are really friendly and i loved general feel of place . unfortunately because of coronavirus i am unable to come in as i am wfh but it was wonderful experience thank you .
__label__Negative	i suggest you listen to governor of nyc and nj . we are instructed to stay home
__label__Negative	due to covid and nyc issues we will not be able to move items on 4/30 and i have asked repeatedly for guidance as to how we are expected to move out when city will be on shutdown . please advise and call me at 215-280-0844 thank you
__label__Negative	charging members rent during coronavirus . have been told to stay at home by government but you still insist on charging us rent . disgusting behavior .
__label__Negative	we are in shibuya tokyo.yesterday wework shibuya decided to stop drinking services cause of corona virus . please give us something to drink or discount rent fee.i am very angry ! ! ! ! !
__label__Neutral	will not grow like they tought they would reducing size of team
__label__Negative	i am very concerned about wework being open during this covid crisis when our state has mandated that we stay at home . i do n't think it 's responsible to have cleaning and community crews in every day to service an otherwise empty building . should also be rent forgiveness program given current situation given so many of your members are small businesses .
__label__Neutral	as small nonprofit we 're looking to cut costs where we can and i wanted to see if we 're able to reduce our rent or what it would look like to cancel.some quick notes about org./our team adventure project 501c3our mission is to lift people out of extreme poverty through job creation ( currently our programs are in africa ) after cutting salaries and running our financial projections since covid- 19 we 're looking at 3 - 6 months left of operational runway . this is just for us to survive- we also owe close to $ 200k to our program partners by end of 2020.our founder is 8 months pregnant and has dengue fever ( something that compromises your immune system and stays with you always after getting it ) so we 're obviously not using office currently.notes about our lease agreement ( attached ) rent = $ 3910/monthwe rent 10 person officeour lease is from august 1 2018 for 36 months.most of our biggest donors are unable to support us at this time because they are having their own financial concerns . we 're applying to government grants and are keeping close eye on other options as they roll out but rent continues to be one of our largest expenses .
__label__Neutral	i was wondering if is way for a.c. to be little less cold on 2nd floor here at 379 w. broadway in ny . after recent warm-up weather has turned deceptively colder making it likelier for people to catch cold especially if office is too cold . with current hysteria over wuhan virus any sneeze is likely to create concern in others even if it is sneeze from an innocent cold . that is why i was wondering if a.c. air can be made tad warmer . thanks .
__label__Negative	thank you for your email but what most members want is not virtual coffee or yoga . paying same rent whilst not using offices at all is killing them including myself . hope to hear from you soon regarding rent and future plan .

__label__Neutral	i should not be charged in march and april . is mandatory order in new york city that non-essential workers can not work from their office . please refund my .
__label__Negative	staff at wework is very friendly and they do organize some cool perks ; however cleanliness of place can use some work . our organization rents big office from wework but floor desks and general area in our office do not cleaned for many days . is dust everywhere ; and given coronavirus situation it would have been great if wework is more cautious of making place clean as well as leave lysol products and hand sanitizers everywhere . thank you . rbc employee
__label__Neutral	potentially staying if covid-19 situation improves . b
__label__Negative	disgusted with your approach to covid and still charging tenants despite `` shelter in place '' regulation.this is horrific .
__label__Negative	reduced one person office to hot desk and working from home due to national and state of nevada laws restricting use due to covid19 . i feel wework should have immediately allowed this reduction and not forced me to pay thru may because i see it as an effort to support wework w/o just leaving- i thought your goal was to help start ups and small businesses . i am disadvantaged wosb who believes in and supports wework summerlin las vegas while putting next to no extra burden on their overhead . )
__label__Neutral	coronavirus life
__label__Negative	i 'd like to if wework has any plans on suspending and crediting membership until crisis is over . we may not be able to back into our offices until may . especially in nyc area . we ca n't pay for space we ca n't use . please advise.what i find interesting is that almost every company that i 'm aware of has made some type of human gesture to help businesses keep . however wework has not . they have stayed open and quite frankly put you all at risk so they are n't in breach of contract for space availability . even if i could to my office and even if i wanted to put myself and others at risk who is coming to meet me ? we are all suffering but this is more than business issue this is human issue . it 's not just bad business it 's bad idea .

__label__Neutral	artie and sebastian i hope you ’ re both keeping well during these difficult times . i ’ m emailing because i received email reminder saying payment for our office will be taken on 1st april . as small e-commerce business i ’ m sure you can appreciate how much we ’ ve been hit by covid-19 pandemic and this rent payment will really affect us . i ’ ve spoken to community team in our building ( 15 bishopsgate london uk ) who have said someone will contact me in due course to discuss this further however i ’ m concerned that this will be too late . speaking to other coo ’ s in my network someone else received response saying `` unfortunately i am unable to stop billing process and any business leniency in regards to freezing membership will be communicated by global leadership team ” . as part of start-up and small business community that have supported wework for number of years i would really appreciate something in return regarding billing for next few months . we work with number of large companies ( facebook amex etc ) who have all relaxed their payment terms or provided other forms of support and it would be great if wework could follow them in this regard ( like hubble are starting to ) .

__label__Negative	with covid dicease and quarentines to have co-work space can be risky inverstment . right now we re paying for 3 work spaces that we are not using . community is nice but investment for an office we ca n't use is very high and we work has been silent and indifferent to costs .

__label__Negative	we have been at our location with varying numbers of offices since our site opened . it is great concept . however of late we have been increasingly dissatisfied and concerned . we were out of toner to print for over month . repeatedly told desk ... oh we ... .would be response . then market went dark for months . we are in an area where is no where to grab soda . now everyones offices have stashes of food and drink . market did show back up recently . now with corona virus and everyone being so cautious ... .one side women restroom was out of soap this week . today other women 's restroom only has paper towels sitting on table where everyone has to pick up entire roll thus touching center and passing germs on that . unacceptable . holder is totally empty of towels . so playing devils advocate that supplier is out of paper towels for that holder pay 10 for holder so we do n't have to cross contaminate ourselves trying to wash our hands ! ! ! ! !

__label__Neutral	thank you for being so helpful . we love new people in our building even though we arent in building because of chinese virus .
__label__Neutral	we were concerned enough to stop using community spaces in march in fact we stopped using our own suite entirely as of march 11 ( our ceo instructed us all to work from home given building situation ) - when wework reported that community member tested positive for covid on march 12 and government recently banned everyone from using all offices on march 20. separately we are having trouble collecting on invoices due from our customers some will pay in whole or in part at later date and others may go out of business . we will be working hard in months ahead to replace that revenue but short term we need to reduce our expenses to maximize our odds of long term success.we realize this is difficult time for you also and we would rather find constructive solution than move out abruptly . i would like to submit following for you and 750 management team to consider you credit back our march payment suspend april & may payments and we add two months to back end of our term at our current monthly rate . assuming office is open safe and functional we will resume normal payments in june and extend term to feb 2021. look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and coming up with resolution that works for both sides

__label__Negative	negatives:1. not enough meetings rooms after phone booths were removed but plenty of empty offices that are locked and not available for use2 . bathrooms do not have toilet seat covers ( very unsanitary especially now with covid-19 pandemic starting to spread to this very county we 're located in ) .positives:1. community team is exceptional . kiersten austefjord adriene matsudaira and lindsey palmer are solely responsible for majority of positives for this score . without them your score would 've been at best 4. they are responsive helpful and have very positive attitudes.2 . amenities and common areas are very well done and comfortable while still providing professional setting for work to be done . 3. location is very good .
__label__Neutral	hopefully covid will be gone soon
__label__Neutral	i love community team and i love working out of wework but i sure do n't like covid -19 just to ensure an extended precautionary measure i have decided to work from home !
__label__Positive	i will be back when covid 19 is over .
__label__Neutral	they are supposed to transfer april 1st into window 3p ( from 3p interior ) would like to postpone start of new agreement .
__label__Neutral	work from home during covid crisis and then most likely back to we work labs .
__label__Negative	you have treated dock 72 members in most appalling and unprofessional manner . i signed up to be in dock 72 for may 2019. that got delayed and i did not in until october . i moved into an incomplete space without many of promised amenities . all this i could have dealt with - i it ’ s tough setting things up . but your misleading unkind and frankly irresponsible dealing with covid 19 is what has finally finished it for me . never will i recommend this company to anyone for anything .
__label__Neutral	wework team we are in financial industry and we will require access to our wework space throughout shelter in place period . i ’ ve also submitted support request per below e-mail but i also wanted to follow up directly via e-mail . what else do we need to do to ensure access ?
__label__Neutral	my finance department at fever hq has asked me to reach out to you about negotiating terms of our wework lease for april and may as i 'm sure many companies are doing at moment . first does wework plan on extending rent freezes to your tenants given covid-19 situation ? please let me what plan is on your end . fever is asking for each of our markets - new york los angeles and chicago - to postpone payment of our april and may rent payments . as you our business is in live events space and unfortunately this is having major effect on our company worldwide . do you think this would be possible ? keeping in mind that landscape may change and we may be able to return to office sooner than june and that we have plans to expand to more markets this year and continue to stay in weworks for future markets as well . let me your thoughts and if postponement is possible .
__label__Neutral	member was terminated from his contract so he now has no income and no need for space . has already vacated and is requesting move out for 3/31/2020
__label__Neutral	covid concerns
__label__Positive	well maintained . courteous staff . good prevention for covid-19 .
__label__Neutral	member originally requested to receive refund for their prorated membership fees for march as well as all april membership fees waived due to confirmed covid-19 case in their home location . after explaining to members precautions that have been made before and after confirmed case they are requesting an early termination effective march 31 2020 as their team has concerns using space during this time due to health and wellbeing if their employees . member is refusing to accept an april 2020 move out date .
__label__Positive	thank you for doing great job team victory park ! i hope to see you soon when covid19 is memory of past .
__label__Neutral	i would be join wework once current covid-19 scenario is over .
__label__Neutral	i intend on returning following covid-19 is resolved .
__label__Negative	i just got reminder about my “ upcoming charge ” and am truly disgusted nothing had been done about this . gov . newsom has ordered everyone in california to stay home except to food care for relative or friend obtain health care or go to an “ essential job. ” people working in critical infrastructure sectors may continue to go to their jobs.weworks greed based loophole of being considered an “ essential business ” does not magically my business an essential business . - my business is service based involving groups of kids ( dance classes and camp ) - my business has been shut down for weeks solely because of covid19 - i have two young children who ’ s schools are closed that i must now homeschool . - i have immunocompromised father that i will not put at risk . i am hopeful that if we as community follow stay home executive orders we can through this and be back to work soon . until then i trust my previously favorable feelings about wework will be renewed by making choices in support of protecting it ’ s communities health and well being during this horrific pandemic .
__label__Negative	well i 'll say it again . i do not think it is very neighborly or decent of y'all to uphold 30 day move out policy for folks that have been laid off as direct result of covid-19 . especially when they cant even legally utilize that office space at this time .
__label__Negative	your response to coronavirus is unacceptable . here in nyc people are legally required to stay home . your own employees are staying home . and you are charging me rent because your doors are unlocked and i could conceivably break pause and willingly increase infection rates for myself my family and others .
__label__Neutral	subject to amendment to agreement between ww 1460 broadway tenant llc and papaya global inc. dated june 30 2019 we hereby give notice of termination of agreement.according to current situation in which our employees work from their home and do not use their membership we will ask for your consideration to terminate engagement even before termination date pursuant to this notice ( 2 months that end at may 17 2020 ) in order to reduce our costs.please confirm receipt of this termination notice and advise on process ahead .
__label__Negative	for now too much downsized ops . due to covid-19.. currently only bottles of water is served but appreciate more variety and revitalizing concession stand .
__label__Negative	in this unpredictable time where covid 19 is widespread and i noticed that recently one of cleaning staff has been showing up to work sick and coughing without covering her mouth for over week out of an abundance of caution i decided not to continue with renewing my membership . i do n't want to put myself health at risk .
__label__Negative	members have been failed by wework during covid . every day their is news story about your board fighting with softbank and question of wework cash flow is constantly in question . your response has been to pretend nothing is happening and not reassure members . it ’ s really disappointing as brand has always been about members but when it came to it wework has not provided .
__label__Negative	i am sorely disappointed with how wework london handled this matter by dragging their feet and coming back with less than empathetic offers in spite of covid19 extraneous circumstances .
__label__Neutral	loss of clients from covid 19
__label__Neutral	financial issues due to covid-19
__label__Positive	work environment is great and staff are very positive helpful and professional . kaitlyn herzog is doing fantastic job especially given current corona virus situation .
__label__Neutral	corona virus safer at home
__label__Neutral	mark hope you are fine . what crazy situation ... because of covid -19 we have not been working in our office for more than 10 days and won ’ t come back before 1 month or more… moreover 2 of our employees will leave our company . that ’ s reason i have 2 questions 1. is it possible not to pay half march and 100 % april rent ? we do not use our office because of this exceptional time and need your help for our costs . 2. as team will reduce can we move . 1st of may until 31st of august for 2 desks office . 1st of sept we will need 3 desks office . thank you for your flexibility and return .
__label__Positive	will come back to wework once coronavirus stabilizes
__label__Negative	wework is breeding ground for spreading disease particularly in state/city where people continue to ignore safety measures put in place by state government . this is irresponsible to say least . stop putting your financial interests before human lives . conscience and close your locations for god ’ s sake .
__label__Negative	after reaching out months ago about cleanliness issues ( and repeatedly before that ) and trying to go to month at our current rent rate we were met with much resistance and sort of `` too bad '' response . even despite poor service we decided to go month to month while agreeing to an increase in our rent . then on march 16 we submitted request to leave based on covid above mentioned concerns concerns about shared workspace continued issues with cleanliness etc . we were only offered relief if we engaged in signing contract to long term agreement . such bad policy especially in time like this . feels very much like opportunizing in time of crisis . seems ironic for company that is supposed to foster strong sense of community care to be so unsupportive in current state . eveytime in past several weeks that we wework email i think this must be rent adjustment policy or pause in membership etc . but it has never come . we have very bad taste from this `` wizard of oz '' answers always where people working at tower49 said they did n't have authority and would send an email request to those higher ups . we are exiting immediately . upon stay at home mandate being over we will collect our items . if anyone would like to reach out to me please feel free to call me at 917-972-2872 .
__label__Negative	disguising and you should be far from proud way you have behaved ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no response to tenant queriessending cleaners in to clean empty buildings # coronavillains
__label__Neutral	although our contract says 30 day notice i am asking that be waived due to covid 19 outbreak . when its all clear i will still need workspace . if you are fair about refunding april rent since i did not use space for most of march as well i will consider using your space for our company . thank you .
__label__Negative	overall service is subpar . it 's clear that wework team prioritizes communal floors versus floors that are rented out completely by business to ensure visiting wework members feel like they are getting what they pay for from membership dues . bathrooms on 6th floor are consistently dirty and not cleaned daily . sink in mens room has been broken for over month . only one works . we repeatedly have to ask for soap in men 's room . not sure why when corona virus and flu season are at high.the water bottle/fountain station is broken and drain is clogged . nobody has ever cleaned it or fixed . it is disgusting . kitchen never has enough paper towels which forces people to go to bathroom to find paper towels to drive their hands.the general sentiment from office to our office manager is when are we moving ?
__label__Negative	could have been more proactive when it came to covid19
__label__Neutral	mark ok i understand even if i am disappointed you did not offer me anything… ; ( let ’ s move for 2 desk 1st of july . is it possible to have available 2 desk office next to us ? we ’ ll see for sept if you are 3 or 4 or more ...
__label__Neutral	to my house dawg . covid tingz .
__label__Negative	we really think wework is very good but because of corona virus we want to stop wework for this period maybe will move back after virus i try to contact wework staff at end of jan but because of chinese new year and virus are noone reply me . wework open very late like 10th of feb due to virus and we move all our stuff right away . we want to ask for end day is end of feb but your staff must end till end of march ... ..i think in special situation should treat us with some consideration not just go by contract . its very disappointed ...
__label__Neutral	would return in private 4 seater working from home now due to covid-19
__label__Neutral	thank you for updating us on situation . we are requesting that meyer law group be considered an essential business conducting essential activities per county orders.our need to enter building is not significant but our value to community is quite critical to bay area .
__label__Negative	i liked everyone here . location of my particular desk was odd in this weird mezzanine thing that involved too many doors and security swipes to to coffee . coronavirus does n't help desire to go to shared coworking space .
__label__Positive	sydney has been great manager for us especially as we navigate through this unprecedented time . we wish to acknowledge and thank her for her service . we hope that we will reconnect with wework once covid situation has been resolved .
__label__Neutral	we are requesting march 31 end date per our earlier email correspondence due to covid 19 and downturn in our business . we want to be placed on `` pause '' for month of april while we sort this out . we will try to remove all of our belongings by 3/31 .
__label__Neutral	taking away all amenities during corona virus feels like completely transparent cost saving measure . you can milk at conbini but not here ? really ? no ice maybe makes sense but no coffee or market is far beyond necessary . other than that place was great staff is incredible !
__label__Neutral	as agreed you will keep our service retainer pending our return in june 2020 subject to covid 19 and we will retain our deactived cards and keys ready for reactivation upon our return .
__label__Negative	whole coronavirus is creating lot of uncertainty and as business is new one i do not feel like paying expensive prices of wework when government most likely announce soon no one should go to work and people remain home ...
__label__Negative	this is totally irresponsible .
__label__Neutral	will offices/meeting rooms in san francisco remain open for members to use ? if not will wework be waiving membership fees ?
__label__Neutral	apijet occupies 6 offices at westlake tower in seattle totaling 47 desks . all 47 desks up are for renewal 7/31 . they are requesting to early terminate all their offices except for their 12p . in exchange for this flexibility they offered to sign for another 6 months on 12p ( 7/31 - 1/31/21 ) . apijet provides defense software for airlines carriers . as airlines industry has been hit very hard by covid-19 they need drastically less space to continue operating as company . they are long standing partners with wework having been members since 2016. just three weeks ago they were looking to expand their presence with us by 30 % and we were planning on touring them on 50-60 desk skus this week ( before covid changed our plans ) . when we through covid-19 they want to grow with us again . given business impact they 're seeing becuase of covid and long standing partnership we 've seen with them over past few years i believe this warrants consideration as an exception .
__label__Neutral	do you have any plans to offer payment freezes or discounts ? we are in aldate tower well we aren ’ t for next few months !
__label__Negative	wework has shown no flexibility with recent covid-19 pandemic and impact it has on remote workers and teams . wework is more interested in profits than safety of members and guidance they receive from employer and world health organization . in times of crises 30 day cancellation policy and member agreements should have flexibility . at this point not sure i would return to wework when all this is over .
__label__Negative	wework is not what it was not because of virus pre-virus . cleaning staff and people who coffee have no relationship with members and are not enough of them . member network is dysfunctional . member benefits are not up to date promoted ( discounts on goods and services ) or pat of experience . learning events are not in line with business needs . are less perks . furniture needs help . community staff is doing more with less and are always trying to help .
__label__Neutral	working from home until covid-19 crisis passes .
__label__Negative	dirty bathrooms expensive lack of any message or effort in middle of covid-19 crisis in my building excess of people on same floor lack of meeting room - it ’ s really bad and not worth money
__label__Neutral	thank you for your email . i already sent email of support request to west broadway location ’ s email . our company is one of essential business . ( to go food service ) if you need more information please let me .
__label__Neutral	john sheehy6:30 am ( 3 hours ago ) to mehi mir i understand you might be considered essential business unfortunately we are not so we have no rights to have our employees come into wework which i am sure is empty.i can ’ t warranty we can stay till december because frankly our situation is so volatile at this point . if you can cancel april rent for us we will stay for our our lease if not i will need to ask to cancel our lease immediately . how do i do that and what is procedure ? i hope wework will into consideration that we where one of 1st tenants in building even before we would move in.please let me as soon as possible . thanks john
__label__Neutral	our wework contract is up this march 31 2020. we were unable to start our move out last week due to office being closed on thursday evening and friday . as non essential business will we still have access to building to complete move out this week ? has cleaning of building been completed given members who have tested positive ? i would prefer to go to building in evening and on weekend so we risk less exposure to other members .
__label__Neutral	working from home but will rejoin wework once covid is over .
__label__Positive	thank you for hosting and supporting us since 2015. we look forward to reengaging once covid has been mitigated and normal business resumes .
__label__Neutral	i need place to work as my company has closed its offices for fear of coronavirus exposure
__label__Negative	i am stuck in australia because of covid 19. i anticipate coming back in future !
__label__Neutral	sounds great . but i just need to have rent relief during this time .
__label__Neutral	primary member steve hanshaw informed myself on call that as their company is startup they are not doing well in this economy and does not have funding to pay april 's rent . they really love wework and do not want to leave but he is looking for what his options are for following scenarios:1. immediate move out2 . freeze membership until after covid19 is over3 . giving 2 month notice but still breaking commitment
__label__Negative	i think way you 're handling your tenants during corona virus pandemic is poor . 50 % rent reduction when govt . has issued stay at home order ? i was big fan of weworks but not now . this is terrible way to treat your long term customers and its doubtful now that i would refer anyone to weworks . we 'll pay your rent with rent reduction but that you were once looking at tenants that would have stayed with you forever . not feeling like i want to stay in place that charges tenants that have been ordered by govt to stay home ! terrible upper management decision making ! taking care of your tenants would have gone much longer way for you .
__label__Neutral	- cbi 's clients are suffering . this member is an advertising agency for e-commerce companies that ca n't ship their products . they are experiencing significant cash flow problem . they said things should be super challenging next 4-8 weeks .
__label__Neutral	since i am in high risk i have been under order to stay home . i can not come out to access my office . is any sort of waiving of service agreement until crisis passes and i am free to go out . i am not generating income i was before i was categorized as high risk . thank you and stay safe
__label__Neutral	quarantine period because of coronavirus
__label__Negative	corona virus and no compensation when membership is not used .
__label__Neutral	since we last spoke governor cuomo has ordered all non essential firms ( greenwich doesn ’ t fall into that category ) to work from home . i need to discuss either holiday for our lease or stop/start option .
__label__Neutral	their clients are school & non profit they expect no revenue next month so they ca n't pay for monthly fee + they need to work from home
__label__Positive	westlake tower seattle-member quote from email about relief request `` we absolutely love wework and i founded flawless recruit in these halls i met our current and past clients in kitchens grabbing coffee and interviewed my existing team playing ping pong on your tables . my intention is to stay and scale with wework when we endure covid-19 pandemic and are allowed to leave our homes
__label__Neutral	as soon as covid-19 passes . i plan to return to wework . same location .
__label__Neutral	leaving due to circumstances of covid-19
__label__Neutral	my we work office was luxury for our business not necessity . i can work from home but wanted to be in community environment . since that community experience is no longer and i am not comfortable working from public office building i am to work from home . we ca n't pay for luxury expense when we are not using office nor do we feel comfortable and we do n't how long this covid situation will last . i would consider renting here again in future should it financial sense for us . we truly did enjoy our time here .
__label__Neutral	are sanitizer stations present at tower location in burbank ca ? also are cleaning wipe still available for use ? thank you for your help .
__label__Neutral	we are member of london marks square community and as i ’ m sure you are aware uk government regulations are stating that people remain at home and are only permitted out for essential activities . strict regulations currently in place in uk mean that we are not in position to use facilities/services at marks square . we are an ngo with added complication that it takes us about year to claim vat back on wework fee and next 6 months will be putting an economic strain on our operations.i have been trying to find out for some time now what support you/wework will be giving us in respect of our membership fees . similar organisations to yourself are providing rent relief to support their members through these very difficult times.please can someone back to me as matter of urgency .
__label__Negative	under normal circumstances i like facilities . but operations under risk of potential corona virus is underwhelming .
__label__Neutral	as discussed by phone this monday 16th march due to flight restrictions and state of emergency we are undergoing it is absolutely impossible for us to have either our in-house it personnel or our local it suppliers be on site to prepare all necessary it infrastructure on 1st april.besides governor cuomo signed executive order on 19th march mandating businesses to decrease in-office workforce by 75 % so we can not only move our staff from current location but are even obligated to have most of them work in remote.as situation is progressing we believe it would be more realistic to count on taking possession of two spaces on 1st june however in view of recent developments it is unpredictable when situation will allow for it . it is still to see if it will be possible then sooner or perhaps even later .
__label__Negative	expense freeze due to coronavirus ... i will be back when finances better
__label__Negative	no solutions/support during covid-19 quarantine . we ’ re small start-up and have been charged entire month for nothing ...
__label__Negative	taking time out and working from home whilst covid-19 blows over . will return once industry starts to pick back up .
__label__Negative	i will personally sure that everyone i and work with has full understanding of way wework has refused to negotiate or work with us during covid19 crisis and complete devastation of our customer base .
__label__Negative	so if we 're not essential and ordered to stay at home are you providing refunds for rent ? i 'm not sure why we should be paying if we are n't allowed to come in and front desk staff is n't even working anymore nor can we packages or mail .
__label__Neutral	city limits news is an essential service - news agency/ media . we are at 8 w 126th street in ny . let me what else we need to do to register link in email that i received to register did n't work .
__label__Neutral	asking to downgrade within commitment terms 8p until july 31 2020**hi marisa i hope you are keeping safe ! i wanted to in touch as you may recap we recently moved into bigger 8 man office space . we unfortunately have had to let one person go and will not be in posting to add extra people we had initially anticipated.the current situation is putting massive strain on our business given we are recruitment firm and people are unable to attend interviews or particularly willing to consider switching jobs in current climate . we therefore have serious concerns around cash flow and not being able to meet our financial commitments if situation carries on for too long which is onlygoing to be compounded if rent stays at current level.the additional space is very much to be surplus to requirements so i wanted to see what are options are to downscale back to smaller office and help relieve some of financial strain business is under . i noticed office is now shut anyway and we are obviously not to be able to use space for foreseeable future.i that we have contract until july so my hope is we can weather storm and revisit something bigger in july but for now preserving jobs for our staff is our number one priority . if you can send me what office options and associated costs you have that would be much appreciated.i look forward to hearing back from you.bestleon devereux
__label__Neutral	since i am not “ essential ” and ordered to stay in place at home in ca will wework be waiving my membership fees during “ shelter in place ” order in ca ?
__label__Neutral	its been very pleasant to work with wework . however due to coronavirus situation we are avoiding to be in public spaces we will be back once situation will be more settle
__label__Neutral	i usually enjoy atmosphere in wework shibuya scramble square office however i wish wework had thermography in reception in this corona virus outbreak in japan so that they could reduce risk of virus contagion in future .
__label__Positive	thank you for keeping your facilities open at this time . i have been using my wework office as it is safer than my home for work .
__label__Negative	support offered to businesses during covid-19 has been very poor especially when other co-working spaces are offering discounts or rent holidays .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus outbreak
__label__Positive	wework strives to create community and not just create space . in these challenging times ( covid 19 ) is still constant communication flow and are activities scheduled for online interaction . to me this rocks ! ! !
__label__Neutral	can i your assistance on an urgent matter.as i am sure you are aware current climate is causing significant unrest in business community and as such our predicted headcount growth is not to be achieved in short to medium term . in fact if anything our headcount may even shrink over coming period to adjust to new market conditions/ potential recessions in market.i need to some facts/ figures fairly urgently as i am putting worst case contingency plans in place.we currently have lease that ends in approximately july/ august and monthly rental $ 12,257 less $ 1785 discount and i believe this is an 18 pax office space.while i am aware we can not reduce agreed spend on total cumulative rent – are their options to adjust this so we moved to smaller space with lower monthly rental and ( i assume ) lengthened lease so that overall spend was not reducedplease advise and if so – approximately what would be cost at an 8 pax 10 or 12 pax office size ? with or without discounts for signing up for additional length of lease ( as before ) thanks in advance for your speed and discretion in this '' [ cm team responded with policy ]
__label__Neutral	only thing that ’ s bothers me is al of this that is happening right now.. but otherwise as my job had to closed because of virus ’ s for our health i feel good in my posible ways

__label__Neutral	home office for time being . until things pick up again and covid19 is under control
__label__Negative	i would encourage cleaning team to use best practice procedures in cleaning . often i observe cleaning team just wiping door handles and highly touch services with just rag and no sanitzer or cleaning solutions which can promote virus/germ transfer .
__label__Neutral	want to have compensation for their office rent
__label__Negative	i would still reconsider staying if wework offered suspended membership during next few months as coronavirus abates and everyone can come back into social working spaces without fear of contracting disease .
__label__Neutral	working from home on of covid 19 lockdown
__label__Negative	did not notify us when building security told then about potential coronavirus outbreak . it took full day and confrontation from myself to do so .
__label__Negative	lack of flexibility while office is closed during covid-19 and high pressure with 2 hour deadline to recommit to contract
__label__Neutral	i hope you and your family are well during these uncertain times . as you mentioned in your email we are all through challenging times and by sticking together we will through this . it is on this topic that i wanted to let you that as company within wework in old street we provide an e-bike delivery service and now offer an essential shop selling key products such bread eggs and toilet rolls to name few items and deliver within zones 1-3 in london on same-day . accordingly i wanted to offer our service to other weworkers and provide them with unique 15 % discount on all orders to support each other during this time of isolation . details of our service are attached and if you were able to promote this to other members within london that would be greatly appreciated . i look forward to hearing from you and if you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me .
__label__Negative	you have been treating our company terribly during covid outbreak . i would never suggest another business to receive same treatment
__label__Negative	coronavirus has everyone in california on lockdown yet wework would n't let us negotiate out of our upcoming lease set to start on april 1st . by law we 're not supposed to go in to office so we ca n't even use space for ourselves or our employees . we asked if we could at least downgrade to hot desk for few months or postpone start but they said no . only thing offered us was trying to lock us into one year commitment .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus fear
__label__Negative	considering that we are in unprecedented times to corona virus issue and visiting wework would not be possible/allowed at least for next 3/4 weeks time due to restrictions it would be great if wework not bill for this & next month .
__label__Neutral	we have only been associated with you it is for our melbourne campus and due to covid-19 we have n't been linked for that long so is hard to truly judge however your communications are excellent .
__label__Neutral	covid - 19
__label__Neutral	covid-19 not using space enough
__label__Negative	help for covid-19 affected companies is terrible . wework should be supporting companies instead of putting them in bad situations where they are paying for days in office even during “ safer at home ” ordinance
__label__Positive	i had great member interaction other day and i wanted to share it with y ’ all . i was talking with member of katalyst team who had been working tirelessly to fda approval on their full body ems personal home training system and they ’ ve finally gotten go-ahead . they were originally hoping to launch in april but they ’ ve decided to launch pre-orders early and business is booming ! i mean honestly what better time to launch an at-home fitness program than when people are asked to stay home for at least two weeks . it ’ s been little difficult staying positive but this convo definitely illuminated that no matter how scary things things may seem right now can always be silver lining . heart :muscle
__label__Negative	can not afford membership due to implications of coronavirus
__label__Neutral	i want to leave wework in time covid-19 after i will work in wework space again .
__label__Negative	el aire acondicionado nunca funcionó para la zona donde estábamos los baños son resbalosos y ocasionó la caida de una persona y varios estuvimos punto de caernos el número de baños son insuficientes para el número de personas que eramos en el espacio y no se apegaron normas de protección ante covid 19 pues es una zona de alto riesgo de contagio .
__label__Positive	although we are not to renew contract as result of covid 19 crisis surely in future i will consider possibility of returning to work in this tremendous workplace . i would like to say thank you guys .
__label__Negative	i rent small office in dalton place manchester . your email below gives lots of security and reassurances for wework staff but absolutely nothing for tenants . now that uk is on lockdown what ’ s next steps for buildings ? also is any plans in place to pause or reduce invoices to reflect current situation ? or are you keeping them open so that we ’ re forced to pay full rent . wework are not essential buildings to keep open ; most of not all businesses should be working from home .
__label__Negative	central we work handling of covid-19 and treatment of members and community teams during this time is appalling . we work are putting staff in danger and punishing small businesses that utilize buildings by refusing to close and charging full rent .
__label__Neutral	as i ’ m sure you iil has barely been using its space on 10th floor for some time now and we are all working remotely ( except for one employee who doesn ’ t like to work from home ! ) . we are suffering great financial losses in corporate onsite training bookings either postponements or cancellations that go out for several months . we are hereby requesting deferment plan for next 4 – 5 months starting with april 1st payment and through august if at all possible with these months ’ rent added on to end of our lease with no penalty . here is “ hardship letter ” that we ’ ve prepared to help you better understand our situation . please back to us very soon as we need to where we can reduce costs in this extremely challenging time.thanks so much for all of your consideration ! we it can ’ t be easy for wework at this time either . they have seen 64 % reduction in revenue currently .

__label__Negative	dear sir/madam i am an employee that works at wework 615 s college st. charlotte nc 28202. on saturday i received an email from lonjezo maliro-miller that upon getting message that one of members that works in 615 location has corona virus they were to shut down building indefinitely and in meantime clean it . on sunday i received second email stating that area was disinfected and that it was safe to work . i feel that this is pure negligence because virus might have been spread from one person to another and it 's not enough time to verify whether anyone else is infected . its not matter whether area will be safe on monday but upcoming days as well . i hope you can do something about this ! please do not disclose my name with anyone from building . i will also forward you emails that we have received ! thank you !
__label__Neutral	shay i hope you and your family are all healthy and managing through these uncertain times . i 'm reaching out as follow up to governor baker issuing an emergency order ordering allnonessential businesses and organizations to close their physical workspaces and facilities to customers workers and public . like every other business we are impacted by this decision and our uberflip employees are not coming to wework office at 33 arch street . our board has requested to see what options wework will provide to its current tenants to waive reduce or defer rent in light of situation . it 's come to our attention other landlords have waived rent until june . please let us what options are available to us .
__label__Negative	short-sightedness of wework during covid-19 crisis is frankly embarrassing . has been no effort to support or work with companies leasing from wework . i guess sense of community only goes so far ...
__label__Negative	may i please call bullshit
__label__Negative	prior to covid-19 was an issue with others from bigger offices taking calls in hallway that was very disruptive .
__label__Neutral	will first of all i hope that you are in good health and good spirits in this season of pretty unique and not fun pandemic times . all my best to you and yours.based on nature of our business ( face-to-face fundraising ) we are unfortunately had to temporarily lay off employees and close our offices in nyc berkeley and philadelphia . this means we no longer need these office spaces.i 'm sure given nature of weworks work this is also not an ideal time for you all and i 'm sure you have bunch of different things on as far as managing this nightmare.so for berkeley and philly we have annual agreements set up with wework . but here in lies rub in berkeley due to `` shelter-in-place '' order they 've closed office to all `` non-essential businesses '' in philly due to confirmed covid-19 case of person operating in building entire building has been shut down without reopening date.after this health crisis abates we are more than interested to reopen spaces we have with wework . however we need to cancel our memberships in those spaces asap.is way to immediately cancel membership to those spaces for april billing cycle or what exceptions are you making for times in which shared coworking spaces are regulated out of our control by government ?
__label__Neutral	since i live in nj and i commute into city… i am no longer able to do so . what are protocols for getting mail and rent ? since i am unable to travel and my business has been affected what is being done about rent ?
__label__Neutral	( thread with member is very long see next box for request ) member doesn ' want to break their 2 year commitment but they are ready to forfeit their sr as `` sunk cost . '' i do n't see any tools that we have to pause their membership unless we want to offer them 2 months free to try and keep their business .
__label__Negative	why do n't you allow me to freeze until covid situation is clear
__label__Neutral	just saw that wework will be closed due to virus . i was curious does this mean that our payments for next month will be paused until we have further clarity on situation ? since office space can be significant cost in burn would love to some info on same .
__label__Negative	my business is not an essential business . it is service business involving groups of children gathering ( dance classes and camps ) and i had to shut down completely . i have no business to run at moment . i am self quarantining and have two young kids i must now homeschool . please advise on how you will relieve business like mine as i am not able to go to “ work ”
__label__Neutral	due to cornavirus out break we would prefer to stay and work from our own home for now we are trying to avoid public spaces & transports but will be back once situation settle down . its been very pleasant to work within we work we will definiate return !
__label__Negative	i really enjoyed wework atmosphere and people . i ’ m only canceling due to corona virus as i can not use my membership at this time
__label__Negative	disappointing response by wework to covid . incentive offered to keep me after contract up ... not to help weather storm together .
__label__Negative	with current covid situation nobody wants to be in co-working space
__label__Neutral	whole infrastructure has been collapsing slowly but surely . we are in midst of coronavirus outbreak and we have ice buckets out in open because fridge has been broken for at least month without getting fixed .
__label__Positive	scheduled time on inside sales rep ' calendar to discuss 1-49p spaces
__label__Neutral	are any provisions for pausing my membership since i am not able to use space ? or is my only option to cancel and re-enroll when buy local restrictions are lifted ? thank you
__label__Neutral	your email is very nice and heart warming but ignores real issue about what concessions wework are to to assist companies with cashflow in these difficult times . do you file business rates declarations on our behalf if you our accountant says if we have details of these we can possibly claim grants.are you to offer companies rent reductions or payment holidays to help them with cashflow
__label__Negative	i 'm deeply disappointed by wework 's refusal to pause contracts in light of covid . as our non-profit faces serious financial crunch wework has thus far been uninterested in sharing hardship .
__label__Positive	amen ! my community is not under lock-down . while i am vigilant about social distancing and sterilization… i need to work at my office . thanks ! ps team at preston center rocks !
__label__Neutral	we 'll be back.. sorry to go because of covid-19 ( see you on other side ! ..
__label__Neutral	understood about you still waiting to hear back from building management . and yes it ’ s unclear to me too as to whether ny state executive order for non-essential businesses ( starting tonight ) to stop all work would affect potential move-out on tuesday . please allow me to connect with moving company ( mz movers ) and come back to you later by tomorrow morning ? undenounced to me they could be considered an “ essential ” business…on related note were repairs for our suite completed on friday or would still need to be further work done in coming days ? i ’ m trying to gauge how much refund we would be receiving for month of march as we ’ re liquidating all company assets . unfortunately i let go most of our staff on friday which was difficult decision but right one given current circumstance.lastly please keep me posted once you have clarity from your leadership team as to wework ’ s policy for early termination requests . as previously stated i ’ m willing to split money in escrow to pay for april rent in an effort to receive balance ( ~ $ 12k ) as we are small business and are in dire need of cash given that our retail business ( d2c ) has come to complete halt and most of our wholesale orders have been canceled leaving us with product we ’ re unable to sell and huge debt we can not pay back to our lenders at this time . ideally i would like to keep all in escrow ( ~ $ 22k ) and not pay for april rent but i don ’ t if that ’ s reality…many thanks for your continued help as we greatly appreciate your time and effort.sending my best grant
__label__Negative	whilst i have been completely satisfied with wework until now i do n't think that wework are handling covid situation particularly well - i have been waiting for weeks to hear whether or not you will be doing anything to support your members who are individual/small businesses and have heard nothing . other places/services i subscribe to in my life have communicated clearly offered frozen memberships etc yet wework still seems happy to monthly payments for desk i ca n't sit at . it 's unlikely that i will still be wework member this time next month - and for company size of wework i would have expected better crisis management .
__label__Neutral	if covid restrictions continue after may 1 and you have not rented out space we are leaving 28-052 please agree to keep our belongings and we will move out ( part to 28-013 part out of bldg . ) at our first opportunity . thank you .
__label__Neutral	liked culture people customer success team i have interacted with observing their politeness and support specially akshay amanda nishita & hiral.i found wework is right place for startup to motivated being in competitive environment and having an opportunity for collaborating with people from community . wework have many centers for business focusing on location specific for flexibility . an effort that is being addressed to build community surely will evolve in coming time.most importantly need more people to arrange washroom hygiene suggesting office space cleaning staff & workers should have more safety in terms of masks food hours proper shoes masks and gloves ( where ever required ) . right measures for prevention of stopping spread of coronavirus as it becomes threat of working in large community together . kind of health protection and care wall designs at washroom and pantry display outlets .
__label__Negative	i 've worked in weworks before ( times square and bryant park ) but it seems like our room has never actually been cleaned . kitchen area is always dirty . tables and benches have food/crumbs/stains etc on them at any given time . bathroom could use coat hook on back of doors otherwise i have to put my coat or bag etc on table by sinks . i like members page and events /popups but miss honesty market ! also love addition of kombucha to tap on 14 and hope that stays . would also be nice if conference rooms had sanitizing wipes in them because sometimes i run into one at last second and have to avoid someone else 's lunch crumbs or puddle from their cup sweating on table . plus coronavirus . lol .
__label__Neutral	dear wework covid support in response to your earlier email today we operate an essential business . therefore please consider this request for support by avanza capital markets inc. as an essential business under governor cuomo ’ s march 21 2020 new york executive order 202.6. avanza falls within essential business definition 7 “ financial institution ” defined as “ financial institutions including banks insurance payroll accounting services related to financial markets ” as securities and exchange commission registered broker-dealer regulated by financial institution regulatory authority and securities investor protection corporation . please continue to support us and permit access to our office space . if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me victor gill or manuel sevilla .
__label__Negative	yes . posterity will judge you for not doing right thing when other coworking spaces are leading way in shutting down and helping their members with small margins and small teams not risk catching covid by continuing to use coworking . shame on you .
__label__Negative	as wework longtime member i have to write to tell you how concerned i am in wework 's current statement of policy . california is under state-wide order from governor for shelter at home . so is nyc . both municipalities are two known places of covid-19 transmission at weworks . general lack of transparent communications from corporate ... and then this declaration even as many wework locations have been known epicenter/hotspots of transmission . if you truly are doing this for `` essential businesses '' than stipulation that only businesses that are `` essential '' - i.e . `` healthcare insurance cleaning supplies as you state '' are only ones allowed in wework . anything beyond that can only be interpreted as shocking effort to put profit over public safety . when dust settles history will be harsh judge . i truly hope wework leadership actually reads this .
__label__Neutral	fyi i planned to turn from 1 seat to 3 in april and to more than 10 by end of year . so is small delay but covid wo n't stay here forever .
__label__Neutral	this pandemic is to create financial stress and would suggest to bring down your rental so that its possible for us to rent desk once covid-19 lock down is over .
__label__Neutral	besides fact that i ca n't use office now my revenue was also hurt by covid .
__label__Neutral	will surely resume once this corona virus pandemic is over
__label__Positive	thanks for constant and continue communication on building status in connection to coronavirus . weekly freebies from vendors to sample new stuff are great along with activities coordinated by community staff ! community staff are very helpful and friendly .
__label__Negative	thank you for your service . we look forward to covid-19 crisis ending and to scaling back up to physical offices with wework .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus working from home for forseeable future see above answers
__label__Negative	although wework is great place and structure to work fact that nyc locations have not shut down ( especially locations where covid had outbreaks ) is both irresponsible and inconsiderate to both employees as well as those who have to return to an unsafe environment .
__label__Negative	it is very regrettable that an option to pause or offer reduced rent was not made available during covid-19 crisis . if this was an option i would have stayed . however is so much uncertainty regarding covid that i had no choice but to cancel my membership until i when covid crisis will end .
__label__Negative	wow . basically wework is contributing to spread of this virus and pandemic .
__label__Positive	great place to work ... just not during times of covid .
__label__Neutral	as with everyone else aduivo too is feeling pinch . as of 3:00 pm today i have been forced to terminate 98 % of my staff across three businesses . my restaurant closed in allen my call center closed in dallas and i will be closing aduivo as well as this covid-19 runs rampant across nation . we will be back full-force when this clears but question today is deferment of current rental obligations . is anything in place to help small businesses until we 're able to rebound ?
__label__Positive	good environment but due to covid 19 used space sparingly .
__label__Neutral	looking for our own space currently for post covid
__label__Neutral	nowhere just waiting until covid situation is over as we are not using space right now .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus issue
__label__Neutral	temporarily canceling my membership due to coronavirus . as general mcarthur said `` i shall return !
__label__Positive	keep up good work ! virus will pass.we will all be stronger afterward.luis
__label__Neutral	we have delivery today at aviation house between 1-2pm . team were aware in advance but i wanted to check that delivery can still go ahead and that security team will be made aware .
__label__Negative	at what point are wework spaces in new york to coronavirus threatseriously
__label__Negative	what about cleaning etc. will workers be in or working from home ?
__label__Negative	lack of materials resources . technology does not work . irresponsible management of covid19 crisis
__label__Neutral	they originally asked for rent abatement for 2 months and are now further asking to completely terminate their 21p . they also are asking to switch their payment method as they will not have enough in their for it to be debited out in april .
__label__Negative	remain open ? essential business ? you are greedy - can ’ t wait until my agreement is over !
__label__Negative	i love my co-working space and community at universal north in dupont circle dc . however i will still like to see more aggressive support for small businesses that call wework home . during this difficult covid-19 pandemic i would hope that wework already provide some payment options/extensions or rent reduction to help with strain on halt of business activity throughout this health crisis .
__label__Neutral	! staying home for covid quarantine . will be back when this is all over . thanks !
__label__Negative	overall i love offering -- i have been fan for years . however i 'm not sure i agree with how wework has handled covid response for members .
__label__Neutral	client reasoned that their employees do not feel comfortable in or are mandated not to by government and they are not using space for next few months . they are looking for some sort of flexibility and understanding so that they can continue to grow with wework in future as management team and all employees really love wework .
__label__Negative	my experience with wework has been very good . my frustration is regarding wework 's covid policy . due to regulations in our state we have not used our space for weeks and likely wo n't for next month . these are extraordinary circumstances and i would have expected more cooperation with tenants to work on pausing accounts while we are enduring such financial distress . i was told that office remains open so we will be charged .
__label__Negative	this is business orientated email and truly does not consider financial impact . how selfish !
__label__Negative	great but not so fun . corona virus and poor coffee quality .
__label__Negative	until last week you ’ d have gotten much better score . i don ’ t like way you ’ re dealing with this coronavirus crisis . you ’ re open even for non-essential work in places where that ’ s now illegal . it ’ s an actual health hazard .
__label__Neutral	we are all currently working from home due to covid-19 . we are working with commercial real estate agent who has identified numerous available office space that fits our needs .
__label__Neutral	guys if we are being told from our state and city not to go into wework.. are you crediting any charges occurred during this mandated quarantine ?
__label__Neutral	i am likely to return to wework in event i can recover financially after coronavirus situation . in meantime i will have to work from my new home location in cherry hill nj .
__label__Neutral	work from home until mess with covid says that travel is safe again
__label__Neutral	i am inquiring on behalf of company i work for collaborate in regards to process in retrieving our mail that has been sent to this location . i understand location is currently closed due to covid-19 restrictions . is an estimate date for reopening at this time ? if not is possibility that our mail could be forwarded to different address during this time ? please advise at your earliest convenience .
__label__Positive	we have absolutely loved our time at wework and hope that when craziness of covid19 is over we can return .
__label__Neutral	member is willing to extend an commit for longer term however would like an additonal 20 % off discount for remainder of year .
__label__Negative	ca n't commute to wework with covid situation . wework has not been flexible with membership options .
__label__Neutral	i am not an essential service provider . what does nys stay at home order mean for my wework membership ?
__label__Neutral	because of covid 19 it makes no sense for me to continue membership right now .
__label__Negative	i hope you 're all doing well and keeping safe . i 'm not quite sure who all i need to escalate this to as i would really prefer an honest answer to my question vs canned copy/paste response . based on latest update from shay and continued order by governor baker we are requesting wework to waive reduce or defer rent in light of this situation . it seems to me wework is trying to maintain that it 's business as usual and quite frankly this is fooling no one . this is n't usual for anyone and we need companies like wework to recognize this and accommodations to its policies . just as you are taking precautions to modify your staffing we are doing same it 's about doing right thing and not trying to put profits before people . please let me who i can talk to about this . regards sk p.s . we 're apparently are n't only ones who are disappointed in this decision . it 's really quite sad what has happened in new york i hope wework employees are recovering .
__label__Positive	my job is currently in process of getting people to work from home or remotely . i 'm looking at options in which this is only temporary where if i can be able to use my work computer and use it to do work while in this remote space
__label__Negative	week ago we were informed that at sonycenter someone has tested positive with covid i message all community members with some questions and week after no reply at all ! this is an important issue and we could n't count with them . so we decided to cancel our membership because wework is n't as proactive as we thought
__label__Negative	close your locations ! ! ! ! stop making it easy for people to go out . please !
__label__Negative	still use we work . but we work has not helped us for virus period . still charged office for something we chave not used
__label__Negative	due to recent shut down in ny due to covid-19 of non-essential business it is presumed that wework will be pro-rating our monthly rent for month of march and until such time as we have clearance that we are permitted to return to office from federal state or local government . kindly inform us of what if any paperwork is necessary to be completed to receive proper credit . if any paperwork is needed kindly forward it to my attention . if direct credit will be applied please inform accordingly . thanking you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter . i ’ d like to discuss my with someone . state of ca and city of los angeles have mandated that we stay home and not venture out into public spaces and workplace . other companies we have relationships and monthly contracts with have suspended march and april rent payments and they will re-access for may . we tried to go to our office on saturday and parking garage was closed . we were forced to park on street and subsequently received parking ticket . once inside building bathrooms had not been cleaned and floors were dirty . our facility is not being cleaned and measures are not being taken to clean and sanitize any more than they have in past . mandate from federal government is to stay away from public spaces and we feel that wework isn ’ t designed to support this mandate . i ’ d like to talk to someone about getting credit for march as well as not paying for future months until this virus and global pandemic is behind us . furthermore financial hardship of having this payment each month that we can ’ t work out of is to be painful . please advise .

__label__Neutral	what cleaning measures are you guys taking in regards of coronavirus ?
__label__Neutral	while we do not believe we are in “ essential ” classification we may need to access our ( wework ) site in order to continue to provide “ minimum business operations ” ( “ mbo ” ) to our workforce as permitted in executive order . while we do not anticipate explicitly needing such access we do have certain it/other supporting resources on premise required to allow us to continue providing mbo . we have been advised that building will be accessible on after hours programming and this should be sufficient to allow us to meet mbo however we would require notification should building access situation change .
__label__Negative	none of that . i that wework owns meetup inc. wework claims to have health and safety of its workers and clients as top priority . meetup group in boulder colorado called hikers anonymous is breaking all rules for stopping spread of covid -19. tomorrow they are taking an outing of 12 people snowshoeing not 10 or less in state guidelines . they are also carpooling ignoring social distancing by crowding multiple people into cars for 90 minute drives each way . it 's irresponsible and dangerous to whole country by contributing directly to spread of virus . it also often leads directly to infection and deaths of people in vulnerable groups . i realize this is n't your area but please route this message to proper people in charge including meetup inc .
__label__Positive	i will be back . i love it just need virus to under control .
__label__Neutral	in regards to social isolation measures during covid-19 pandemic i will only work from home .

__label__Negative	it has been very good experience . everyone is so nice helpful and welcoming . transition has been really good . we did notice though that are no toilet seat covers in restrooms and were disappointed particularly now with fear of virus . other than that our employees really like it here . thanks to great team for helping us .

__label__Neutral	staff is working remotely due to covid-19
__label__Positive	devon and adrienne were great as well as other staff . really liked this location before covid hit .
__label__Negative	men 's bathroom on 5th floor is often dirty without paper towel or under repair . amidst coronavirus around it 's important that we all wash our hands consistently and thoroughly . however water in men 's 5th floor bathroom is ice cold yet on other floors i have visited water is warm . very upsetting .

__label__Positive	great place to work when we are virus free !
__label__Neutral	-- i hope my email finds you healthy and well ! given that we wo n't be able to access our offices can we be refunded or credited last 2 weeks of march rent ?
__label__Negative	in light of current health crisis i have decided not to renew my office lease and have removed all items from my space . march payment has already been processed and will be last month with wework until covid-19 virus has been blunted . please let me what further actions are needed as i do not wish to move forward with three month additional term . fortunately no contract was ever signed on my end .

__label__Neutral	in light of fact that wework sf is now shut down for at least three weeks and we ca n't go to office space we are paying for i 'm wondering if you 'd be open to offering us some kind of break on rent ? julie and i would be so grateful if you 'd consider making something work .
__label__Neutral	( ... ) i 'm writing because given our similar businesses i 'm hoping you can help me . our industries are getting rocked right now and we 're reaching out to all of our partners ( i 'm guessing wework is doing same ) to ask for help.with our workspace landscape dramatically shifted for unforeseen future i am hoping we can some rent relief . our plan with new space was to grow rapidly our team month over month and fill space . ironically we had less than 2 weeks in new space before we had to send out notices that employee 's needed to begin working from home for their health and safety.like us wework has dramatically scaled back office operations to barebones crew and most of services that wework amazing will be paused until we back to sense of normalcy.please let me how you can help . we love having you as partner and hope that together we can through these crazy times together.sincerely

__label__Negative	one idea keep security deposit temporarily but allow us to keep our desks and equipment in place until 9/30 . that way you it easier for us to move back and re-contract with you once covid-19 resolves . if we do not come back by 9/30 return security deposits ( you at least keep some cash on hand ) .
__label__Positive	please amend move-out date to april 15th . everyone is great.. it 's circumstances of covid-19 and other personal matters id ' rather not discuss !
__label__Neutral	need to work from home because of virus
__label__Neutral	is any relief that wework could provide us during this time ? what our general counsel suggested upon reviewing our contract was to postpone our monthly payments for period of time with commitment from us that we 'd then add those months to extend our lease when it runs out ( mar/apr 2021 ) .
__label__Negative	love wework - but without any staff at location no mail service ups packages now bouncing and with no drink services i 'm not sure it 's essential or beneficial to our business . prior to covid outbreak it was solid 7-8. with some minor aspects to improve on . now it 's really not any value added from it all . thanks frans
__label__Positive	even in these tough corona virus social distancing moments wework staff continue to offer their attention and support . on and off site . awesome ! ^o^

__label__Negative	dear wework team we have been users of your product for some time and have loved experience . but in past few weeks our small business has taken major hit . if we can not cut costs we will have major chance of shutting down . wework represented for us 80 % of our costs as we just upgraded our plan and got closed office for 3. we tried to cancel but we are forced to pay two full months and we wo n't see our deposit only in few months . we are requesting that you consider refunding us for month of april and give us back our deposit . we have been loyal customers for while but we did not any use out of product for this period and if not for strictly cutting costs we may not be able to return to using your product in future . i hope you understand and ’ s something you can do to help our situation .

__label__Neutral	unfortunately we can not commit to extending our lease on either office at this time . we are asking that you please go to upper management as suggested in your email and please ask for april 's fees to be waived.three notes 1. by mid-april we will have better understanding of what our business looks like in this new reality.2 . by then we will understand what government programs we may benefit from and can impact our decisions.3 . even if wework continues to remain open all of our team members are under strict orders from our state governors `` safer at home '' for california and `` stay at home '' new york . we simply can not access our offices or services they offer .
__label__Negative	dear wework your pr continues to disappoint . by keeping all of your buildings open you continue to put people at risk for covid-19 — your employees and members who continue to go in and out of buildings can and will come in contact with virus at some point and never slow spread . you are blatantly against not only cdc and who guidelines but also local government recommendations and guidelines and direct orders from united states president and staff ... you are defeating purpose of millions of americans and people who are self-quarantined with employees and members still accessing buildings across country . what about their family members at home who are high-risk ? what about after they leave building touching potentially infected surfaces then coming into contact with grocery cart or pharmacy keypad ? you need to step up to plate and be leader in this pandemic . instead you continue to push forward spreading coronavirus and go against any heath professional ’ s advice and call to action . i ’ d expect more from company that is right up with amazon and microsoft and other tech leaders ; you should fall in line with their model of closing businesses and ordering work-from-home guidelines since clearly you are no longer leader setting an example .

__label__Negative	really sorry about this . i loved few months i spent at chromium but uncertainty related to covid-9 is to linger for god knows how long (
__label__Negative	i hope all is well . with ca government shutdown and that state of current crisis we need to discuss alternatives with wework . at this time we need flexibility with our lease or we will be forced to break it as our clients are not spending any money and my company is not generating any income . obviously we would not have just signed an extension and addition to our lease if we would have seen this coming . hence whole point of lease flexibility . unfortunately we just went through round of layoffs and furloughs which is hard and now we need to address this space.effective immediately wework is not to withdrawl any ach payments from our with respect to april for any reason whatsoever until resolution has been agreed to.here is option we would need . waiver of rent for foreseeable future until government deems it safe to go back to wework facilities . i would be more than happy to pay for general mail services throughout this time . but that is it and of course i would not use facilities at all and if needed to we can move all of our equipment out.if this is not possible we will need to discuss canceling our lease and what that means with respect to our deposit during time of crisis that will most likely fall under an “ act of god ” provision and i will most likely need to bring our general counsel in to deal with this.we have not been in office since second week of march as i have felt environment is unsafe for my team and have no foreseeable use of office until this crisis is over which may last way into summer.please let me what actions wework will be taking if any to accommodate this request within next 24-48 hours .

__label__Neutral	korea wework is limiting people with global pass . basically they do not allow due to covid-19 . but working at global company our company purchases global pass at hq ( us ) and distribute it to local employees . so i 'm korean based in korea but basically now allowed to use global pass . but korea wework after week of debate allowed me to use wework korea on from 9am to 6pm . this is difficult as it is hard to work just between those hours.also music on hot desk areas is not ideal working condition and people do talk and eat in these areas . so hard to focus on work.the wooden floor does create lot of noise when people walk and move around stuff on wheels.the pros of working at wework is condition of desks and interior is good . also drinks and ammedities are good.lastly employees at wework do n't do good job in internal communication . my pass was revoked multiple times when i first started when things were being sorted out .

__label__Neutral	abby thanks for update and for sending me copy of contract between eleven six pr and wework . as you we have already given you notice of our intent to vacate premises . our preference is and now that i have reread contract and consulted my legal counsel i believe i am permitted to vacate premises prior to end of march 2020 without additional payment.as you are aware section 6 ( f ) of contract reads as follows ( f ) extraordinary events . neither party is liable for and will not be considered in default or breach of this agreement on of any delay or failure to perform as required by this agreement ( with exception of any obligations on your part to pay any sum of money due to us under this agreement ) as result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party ’ s reasonable control and which such party is unable to overcome by exercise of reasonable diligence provided that affected party will use best efforts to resume normal performance.the declarations of states of emergency by state of new york and new york city have effectively denied eleven six and its employees as of march 7 2020 use of wework premises . that unavailability continues as of this date and it appears that it will do so for an indefinite period particularly if as reported mayor deblasio imposes “ shelter-on-place ” order on new york city . since this failure of wework to perform its obligation ( though no fault of its own ) to its premises available to our employees and clients eleven six pr ’ s obligations under our contract are also suspended . parenthetical phrase excepting our obligations to pay any sum of money due to wework under agreement is inapplicable since our company has no obligation to pay for premises that are not available to us as result of force majeure event . since we have already paid for use of premises in march ( and are presumably entitled to refund of large portion of those funds ) and have given you notice of our intent to terminate our contract as soon as possible we believe it would be reasonable settlement of this matter to permit us to vacate premises as soon as we are able to do so subject to legal restrictions in place and health and safety of our employees which are paramount concerns without payment of any additional sums . we would be willing to forego any attempt to claw back rent that we have paid for march . as all american businesses ( including yours and mine ) are suffering effects of coronavirus pandemic i am sympathetic to your concerns about maintaining your cash flow during this period . i have same concern . but i believe it is in our mutual best interests in this time of national crisis to amicably resolve our difference . i hope you feel same . we expect to vacate by march 31 2020 and not be subject to forced presence and payment for april 2020.please confirm . thank you.best katie

__label__Neutral	original request- pre-shelter in place- as you ’ ll during that transition we increased our space and spend associated with it in part due to 450 lex location . we took two 7 person offices ( 4.098 and 4.102 ) and one 3 person office ( 4.1 ) which sits in between two larger office units . as i ’ m sure you ’ ll appreciate with cv-19 pandemic our overall demand for space has significantly reduced . however we ’ re not looking to exit our agreement for larger spaces which we have – two 7 person units – as we recognise that this is still space which is useful and will continue to be so as long as our business exists . our requirement for smaller 3 person office ( 4.1 ) however is different and we ’ d like to explore how we can exit this space allowing us to continue to operate effectively and use of larger spaces which we ’ ll continue to lease.could we have conversation about exit routes for 3 person office ( reflecting that we ’ d remain in 2 larger and more expensive spaces ) ? modified request- post- shelter in place- i ’ m aware of recent announcement in new york from governor cuomo which has ordered all non-essential workers to cease travel . it would be useful to understand wework ’ s response to this order as it means that we ’ re unable to utilise space which we ’ re paying for – and therefore i ’ d expect to receive some level of rebate to reflect non-usage .

__label__Neutral	after covid-19 to larger and more basic space where i can fit all my books more like an artist 's studio than an office .
__label__Negative	you should explore being able to allow person to retain their desk space in return for keeping service retainer ( just stopping monthly payments ) or keeping small monthly fee running to retain desk during period of significant disruption ( i.e . covid19 ) . i think that would show some loyalty to your members which they would return to you whereas only alternative i have is to terminate my membership .
__label__Neutral	i just received this update however it does not outline wework 's policies for non-essential business . due to extreme uncertainty of what is to come next and how long will government shutdown last until i would strongly request wework management to not charge non-essential business until is further clarity on situation . if possible please provide us with confirmation before end of this month on whether or not wework will continue to charge non-essential businesses for unused space . i hope during this time of uncertainty we can continue to build more meaningful relationship with wework . look forward to hearing from you asap .

__label__Negative	i ’ m extremely surprised and disappointed by content in your email.i have been trying to response from wework relating to rent since march 17th day after prime minister johnson asked everyone to work from home . i did responsible thing by having myself and my team work from home from that date onwards . only response i ’ ve received is that wework is dedicated in supporting its members and that it is their top priority to have further communications relating to rent as soon as possible . it has been 2 weeks since then and i am yet to have clear answer . your community members on front line are being inundated with members like me who need answers fast.it is unreasonable and insensitive for wework to continue to charge rent when members have been told not to go into office by government . has also been number of wework members testing positive to coronavirus which suggests that co-working environments are very unsafe place to be at this time.additionally wework are not delivering on many of membership benefits that are fees pay for . wework prides itself on offering much more than office space and unfortunately none of membership benefits exist at moment other than yoga or meditation class here and . i can say very confidently that majority of wework members don ’ t care yoga and meditation they care about keeping their business alive and their jobs intact.i have been huge supporter of wework since becoming member and have always spoken highly of our experience to other business owners . sadly all of positive experiences we ’ ve had with wework have been overshadowed by last 2 weeks.a few months ago i committed to doubling our desk count as our company grew . weeks later our cashflow is at complete standstill i ’ ve had to let staff go and we ’ re dealing with company charging us rent unreasonably.i have blocked payment of our membership fees for april and will not be returning to office if wework are not able to resolve this problem as matter of urgency.you owe your members better than this .
__label__Neutral	taking work from home until covid -19 situation improves .
__label__Positive	triangle building denver - member came in to mail and was so relieved to see staff . he opened large check that came in mail and said “ we can now pay our staff and stay open for another month . thank you for being here ! ”
__label__Neutral	amidst this covid 19 scare we are all confined to working from home and are highly unlikely to come for entire month of april 2020. hence it would be great if wework can waive off membership fee for april 2020
__label__Negative	to whom it may concern fact that you have nerve to say that some of your companies that work at wework are essential is beyond ridiculous and complete lie . you don ’ t have grocery stores pharmacies or hospitals . therefore your business is non-essential and so are companies who call wework home . not to mention that you have had 3 cases of covid-19 at 3 different locations in nyc who are employees of your company and yet you still have audacity to stay open is beyond disgusting . our country is dealing with massive health crisis . just because you had terrible ceo and now wework is struggling financially doesn ’ t give you right to put people ’ s health and well-being at risk . i have been member of wework for 2 years and have just signed lease for another 2 years but this behavior is making me question kind of company you are and whether having my office in your space is right decision for my company . given that you aren ’ t doing right thing i will have to decide how i want to handle knowing this information . it seems to me that if ny government knew that you were defying their rules for your own personal gain they may have something to say about it . and i ’ m sure if i reached out to other members with this information they may feel as strongly about your absurd behavior as i do . just because you email information to your members it doesn ’ t it true . i would reconsider your decision to put our health and well being at bottom of your priority list . at very least you owe your members this much respect . i look forward to hearing your response to this .
__label__Neutral	i ’ m in an area of mandatory shelter at home and my business is non-essential . is wework to be waiving rental fees in these areas ? additionally will credits for rooms and printing be rolled over ?
__label__Neutral	wfh - coronavirus
__label__Positive	i will definitely return once covid thing gets over .
__label__Negative	no option to pause payment during coronavirus outbreak
__label__Negative	1. i think that service quality has gone down bit since reorganization of corporate . we always experienced lot of churn in our community team and it seems to have accelerated.2 . has been no effort to offer us discounts for offices we are not supposed to use during this covid crisis.3 . i think pricing is bit high compared to other space companies i have explored . 4. part of wework 's value prop is having access to network of other buildings and conference rooms however when you book room at building that is not your own you access is limited to 9am to 6pm this does n't reflect way business is done in nyc . 5. our front desk does n't open until 9am . in normal nyc building desks are staffed 24/7 again this makes early morning meetings problem .
__label__Neutral	we need to continue our business in virtual way due to covid-19 . once that passes we will then seek an office at that point in time .
__label__Positive	during covid-19 crisis we will be scaling back to virtual 'wemembership ' relationships as well as keeping two colleagues in hot desking spaces in vancouver . once crisis passes we will be seeking physical space and ideally staying with wework .
__label__Negative	- 30 day notice for move out should be lifted ( or flex 'd ) for month-to-month people ( we could n't have about covid & we are stuck paying for something we wo n't use which for business of three is directly taking from personal income . )
__label__Negative	some of staff our wonderful . some we have been forced to deal with are clueless and do not how to run space . furthermore space pre covid 19 was extremely filthy - especially bathrooms .
__label__Negative	manager at miami brickel center does n't have clue about client experience and personas at front desk on 5th floor neither . very bad experience wondering that´s why she could not manage propper mesures towards covid 19
__label__Neutral	will look for larger office ( 15+ in wework if possible ) once covid is done .
__label__Negative	if we are under order by our state government to have shelter-in-place will you be waiving our april rent payment and crediting half of march ? due to financial constraints without that we may need to terminate our relationship with wework altogether .
__label__Negative	facilities access and support available during covid-19 coronavirus pandemic .
__label__Neutral	corona virus concerns ( we would have stayed had situation not changed so dramatically )
__label__Neutral	dear wework team i am writing this email in light of recent worldwide events and circumstances surrounding covid-19 . i was hoping we would not have to resort to this but our company elite sales and services ( gvb ) has experienced an extreme reduction in workload and revenue as vast majority of our clients have been forced to shut down and freeze operations . given that state of california has implemented shelter in place policy and that we are not allowed to resume our regular operations at wework we would like to find way to relieve our financial burden while at same time maintain our responsibilities owed to wework . by means of this email we would like to ask that you postpone or reduce our rent due for months of april and may . we have been large customer of wework for some time and would greatly appreciate support in these trying times . it is of extreme importance to our company to maintain relationship we have built with wework and that we are able to continue our operations after our nation has surpassed this unexpected blow . we are hoping that we are able to come to an understanding where both elite sales and wework are able to find mutual grounds during these difficult times . please feel free to reach out to me directly . looking forward to your response .
__label__Negative	i have enjoyed my experience at wework until quite recently until staff change and later coronavirus crisis . for me option to be able to hot desk in other locations was one of main perks and something i will miss . for me crisis response and messaging and wework ’ s willingness to expose its members and front-line employees to risk were deal breakers .
__label__Positive	will likely return post covid-19 .
__label__Neutral	i hope you are well . i am emailing as i wanted to inquire about canceling our membership . due to covid-19 we are having to adjustments in our budget to adjust for all revenue loss we expect to happen in upcoming months . at our restaurant down way we have lost all of our events through may and have seen dramatic decrease in business due to everyone working from home which is to have long term effects on business in upcoming months . once we recover we would like to come back .
__label__Neutral	i have greatly enjoyed wework and it 's been an incredible experience . staff other residents facilities . and i hope to return . but for now i 'm leaving with hope that by not being in communal space all day i have better chance of not catching virus or at least delaying spread . thanks !
__label__Negative	we 've been happy with office and community team . elle stan tom & byron have been most helpful . we will miss interaction with them moving forward . covid 19 situation has made it impossible for us to sustain our office unfortunately .
__label__Negative	weeks prior to covid wework was doing nothing to stop its spread . no alcool gel anywhere nothing . they said they sent warning messages to people i didnt receive anything no signs anywhere . this was eminent and coming and nothing was done . i lost all trust in you guys .
__label__Negative	due to covid 19 i have to cancel my membership and wework is charging me for month april . it is very mean to stick with contract during this period . we work had to end our contracts at end of march . also issuing some compensation for march would be appropriate .
__label__Negative	so i guess you were on spring break beaches of florida - it is ok to congregate . i am shocked by these emails ? ? .
__label__Neutral	because of covid-19 i 'm working from home now . just switch to hot desk for now although i may not be often due to current covid-19 situation . will upgrade to bigger room in future when things are getting better .
__label__Negative	really disappointing response ( i.e . none ) to covid . no communication relating to rents or rates for grants . abysmal for one of largest commercial property providers in world .
__label__Neutral	we are currently tenants in 880 3rd avenue . as you can imagine our business is being heavily impacted by current unprecedented situation . therefore we need to freeze/ reduce our rent obligations immediately . who can we speak to ? based on phone call renovata does executive search// face to face interviews and companies are placing these hiring processes on hold// revenue streams are frozen
__label__Positive	thank you for everything ! i really wish i could have stayed . however current covid 19 situation will likely keep me at home for time being .
__label__Negative	right now we work has had 2 corona virus outbreaks and is an office we can not use
__label__Neutral	they will empty office by april 1st and want to how much sr will we keep .
__label__Neutral	we have been charged whole fees during covid-19 quarentine
__label__Negative	i have loved wework and have been tenant since 2014. three months ago i would have given wework 9. but i believe response to covid virus has been insufficient . wework should give people break on rent or freeze memberships . i realize you are not in financial position to do so . however having listened to podcast wecrashed it seems due largely to gross mismanagement . also we have been asking for months for someone to fix phone booths . sound leaks horribly since they were `` upgraded '' 1-2 years ago . but despite promises nothing has been done . so you are like president of us we ca n't believe what you say .
__label__Neutral	just shifting down for moment during covid - will sign up for another smaller office shortly when we move in policies
__label__Negative	i did ask for space for two of us but pricing was too high . i though given availabilities in my section alone would have been more wiggle room pricing . subsequently with virus its just not economically feasibile anymore .
__label__Negative	i loved working there- but with covid you left very bad taste in my mouth ... shira and morgan were always extremely professional and responsive.. they were best part of working at wework
__label__Neutral	good morning . now that all wework locations are closed due to covid-19 . what happens in regards to monthly charge ? will this be reimbursed or not charged at all ? many thanks
__label__Neutral	covid 19 has changed long term plans .
__label__Neutral	thanks for getting in touch . still waiting for decision on rental payments . would be great if you could address that .
__label__Negative	i ’ m sure you ’ ve had similar response to your email such as following . we ’ re now locked down nation and told to self isolate and not travelto non essential work . and so desks i and many have rented have been rendered useless . as dictated by our government we need to practice self isolation to protect ourselves protect others and protect our nhsso why are wework not doing anything about this to help members who are rendered home bound and working remotely by freezing desk rents until these restrictions are lifted ? ! ? this is utterly ridiculous and unfair . many other members are making lot of noise about this injustice on various groups not least because this reflects badly on wework as company and its practices . please send out communication which addresses concern of most of wework members with fair and satisfactory resolution .
__label__Positive	i 've had few difficult calls with westlake tower members today but their overall appreciation for our continued ( and positive ) communication is definitely apparent ! they mentioned how much they miss coming in and how when all this is over they ca n't wait to come back to office . quote from pm `` we absolutely love you guys '' and then proceeded to comment on how truly kind and supportive we are .
__label__Negative	moving to larger office space once covid 19 is over it was always our intention and this has just brought plans forward .
__label__Negative	please decide on how to operate under corona virus or refund tenants for their rent . we are n't getting any value for what we are paying for .
__label__Neutral	i still do n't anything to dring here due to coronavirus . nothing special here so far .
__label__Neutral	business temp . shut down until july . all tv shows they work on are on hold until further notice asking to move out now on commitment until august 2020. can not afford payments also does not feel safe to access la17 due to covid-19 case found in building .
__label__Negative	it would 've been alot more helpful if wework made accommodations to honor my request to cancel membership end of march due to covid-19 pandemic instead of sticking with membership agreement of 30 day notice to move out . in other circumstances i would have honored lease agreement .
__label__Negative	it ’ s criminal that you are staying open . shut it down for love of everyone ! ! ! this is like saying “ we ’ re gon na keep 24hr fitness open because one of our members is firefighter ”
__label__Neutral	this member is requesting to downgrade into an office less than $ 2000/mo willing to extend current commitment . theyre on commitment through january 2021 .
__label__Negative	i actually this space is amazing - 655 k st newest one in dc . and i think staff is great ( devon i believe is one of people i have interacted with ) .but i was little disappointed to see today - i felt ok coming here during pandemic b/c not lot of people are here and wework had sent out communication about stepped up cleaning efforts . but i could see today at common area i sat at yesterday crumbs from my lunch were still on table . similarly another place i had been at standing area near window facing new york st on 7th floor . so it seems to me that tabletops are not being wiped down which seems counter to guidance we are getting regarding virus and additional cleaning .
__label__Negative	organization is so unorganized . i have dedicated desk and they have no way of knowing who has what desk and they randomly assign desks and ca n't even keep track of them . i am most upset with how poorly they have handled covid 19 and am planning on switching to work space that takes public health seriously .
__label__Negative	you should 100 % be closed while covid-19 is around .
__label__Neutral	thanks for update . if we already have parcels in parcel room is anyway of gaining access to these ?
__label__Negative	our business does not qualify as essential under new york state law . therefore i want to if we will be getting credit for our rent while we can not access office .
__label__Neutral	we are to retain wemembership or two so that we can hold an event which was planned but cancelled due to novel coronavirus issue which was very unfortunate .
__label__Neutral	working from home until covid-19 situation clears .
__label__Negative	elevator goes out of service more frequently.which makes our employees nervous whenever they feel any bump inside of it . also utensils are not properly cleaned . i still see many broken mugs or dirty mugs on shelf . not enough spoon forks and all mixed up inside dirty container . specially now with this corona virus issue not only maintenance team but everyone in this building including ourselves should pull up our socks and do our best to keep environment clean
__label__Neutral	due to covid-19 issue our company nasu are facing really hard time . we have to cut our expenses to avoid bankrupt due to significant drop in revenue . lots of our partners are closed including ski resorts and other event coordinators . i have to hard decision which nasu may move out of office . before i decision may i what loss may be caused by breaking lease ? i are 1.5 of basic rent as retainer fee will not back . is any other fees may apply ? i love wework community and really enjoy days work together with you .
__label__Negative	terrible handling of covid situation buildings should be closed .
__label__Positive	thank you so much for your message and link to nhs yoga and meditation . this is so welcome ! i was just about to share it but notice that it says all you need is an nhs email ... ..i wanted to check on that . can you advise ? many thanks and hope you are keeping well ) .
__label__Positive	good sharing of items that organizations do n't have to worry about . great front desk professionals who are very attentive . great supporting staff that still have gone to work during covid-19 to sure our place is clean and germ-free . thanks for that .
__label__Neutral	they do not use office because of government .
__label__Neutral	i hope to return once coronavirus concerns settle down . i used space primarily for meetings and everything is remote for now . if you did promotion or allowed me to back in at same or better rate in few months i 'd likely return . thanks very much .
__label__Neutral	cost reduction because of coronavirus
__label__Neutral	email i ’ d like to cancel my wework membership . i ’ m in north carolina and i plan to be here for foreseeable future.email thanks ! i ’ m curious if is way to put my membership on pause . pause it for now and resume paying when pandemic is over and i am back in nyc . i ultimately do not think member wants to terminate their agreement . they are on commitment until july 31st . they are in north carolina with family while waiting this out .
__label__Negative	i offered to downgrade to hot desk and was refused because i was in quarantine and notified after march 1st would not accommodate critical infrastructure business after being exposed to covid by wework employee . now i am leaving all together .
__label__Neutral	we will return to rent space after covid-19
__label__Negative	i would have before covid-19 - as business that touts itself as supportive for start ups not offering any compensation for paying full rent at offices that can not legally be used is very unsupportive
__label__Neutral	asking to terminate their contract and want to see if we can work to backfill their spaces as they are closing their business . last thing i did was let their broker that tour volume is lower now than normal and then referred to ts & cs that state they 'd be responsible for all membership fees and service retainer if they terminated but i 'd look into other options due to these circumstances . is place where they can forfeit their service retainer and/or pay rest of membership fees so they still retainer . are 2 months left on ldn contract and 3 months left on ny contact.how are we handling business who are closing their doors bc of this ? ( https //www.pionline.com/research/tabb-group-close-firm-under-pressure-virus-outbreak )
__label__Neutral	plan to re-up my hot desk membership at this location once covid-19 pandemic calms down .
__label__Neutral	most likely not coming to nyc for while due to coronavirus
__label__Positive	dear shaine and katherine sincere thank you for acting as liason on our behalf and providing us with this update . i wo n't spoke on behalf of group but will plan to circle back under separate cover to confirm updated terms as they pertain to hayworth . i do however want to impart my profound gratitude for your -- and by extension wework 's -- understanding and concessions during these uncertain times . we will be in touch soon ! please care -- stay happy and healthy friends .
__label__Negative	complete lack of flexibility in response to covid-19 and refusal to acknowledge interruption to business for our company . we would never use wework again nor recommend it to other startups .
__label__Neutral	flixbus is impacted by global travel ban and can not operate any more . they are therefore asking for rent reduction of 50 % or rent freeze for next two months
__label__Negative	i don ’ t want another zoom happy hour i want real assistance for covid-19
__label__Neutral	second reach out since covid-19-3.23.20 wework and marisa we would like to postpone our membership for next 60 days due to this global pandemic.please approve asap.ohad
__label__Negative	it is shame to have to leave without intention of returning . by better helping us manage short term impacts of covid 19 on our business with view to long-term office space partnership with wework we would have liked to come back and perhaps stood better chance of navigating this period with support . unfortunately that was n't possible .
__label__Neutral	as we are faced with shelter in policies in state of california is we work making concessions on our rent when we are not able to work from our offices ? pushing rent payments to april 15th would be great as many of our clients are not working as well ; therefore they are slow to pay their invoices . please let us .
__label__Neutral	also based on federal guideline and city order i think it ’ s possible that 4/1 move in is impractical . can we defer move date ?
__label__Neutral	nevin law group is an entertainment law firm that primarily works in theatre industry.- representing broadway productions and traveling theatre groups . with 8 week broadway shutdown & closure of theaters nation wide nevin will not be making any profit over next 2 months and will be forced to chose between paying ww or laying off employees . nevin would like to stay in their current office ( not asking to downsize or break commitment ) .
__label__Negative	fwiw - last thing i wanted to do at moment is commit to any length of time i.e . 5 months or 12 months . really felt options provided around covid-19 were poor . have loved being at wework for past 2.5 years and hope to return .
__label__Neutral	downsizing as result of coronavirus
__label__Neutral	as we all are now not working from offices how do we suspend our office lease ? we have paid for march but can we stop our lease as of april 1st ? governor of ny state has mandated wfh and no office usage . will wework be suspending monthly rents as we need to follow government directive ?
__label__Neutral	until covid 19 situation stabilises we are not in position to be able to pay for office space that we are not using
__label__Negative	we are moving which i informed wework of . but for whole month of april and half of march i could n't use office anyway because of covid . why you did did n't officially shut it down under registration i have no idea . you are only allowed to use office for totally essential work you ca n't do from home so you ww users ca n't use their office .
__label__Positive	member yiran who had signed her move out for end of march due to cashflow struggles got part time job via another labs member funds of which she directly allocated to cancelling her move-out and re-activating her labs membership . yiran said that she needs labs community now more than ever to through these tough months and strategize as her app is in hospitality sector .
__label__Negative	greedy company that remove all drinks and provided stuff progressively until they are removing everything all together to save money and use excuse of coronavirus to look like good guys .
__label__Negative	really disappointed with company overall especially handling of covid-19 crisis . you are charging me rent when i legally ca n't work in office .
__label__Neutral	coronavirus .
__label__Positive	brilliant mail . thank you . hope all is good we wework fam .
__label__Negative	office is never clean bathrooms are often out of toilet paper or hand towels rent is extremely expensive cold brew is during limited hours and often runs out beer on tap was removed no more snacks available for purchase wework did not any statement on coronavirus until after everyone was required to work from home on state level phone booths were removed due to potential cancer causing materials - no replacements were made and no updates were provided to tenants
__label__Negative	wework staying open during this time of crisis is antithesis of creating global community . this feels like self-serving money grabbing move at expense of your members and creating truly safe space . as small business pressure this is putting on my company makes it clear that you don ’ t care about your members . this is beginning of end of 4+ year working relationship . as emerson said “ your actions are so loud i can ’ t hear your words ... ” weworks inability to put community first and close for benefit of its members [ and global community ] shows your true colors and your lack of care . this is charged email mostly because every piece of communication i ’ ve received only deepens my disappointment with how wework has managed and continues to manage this . be leaders in space that needs leadership not an opportunistic self serving organization . p.s . do right thing and close without charging your members . if only you had organizational fortitude and leadership capacity of wing .
